""it was overwhelming to see the dedication and support,"" said peggy stanley, matagorda adopt-a-beach coordinator. ""we even had some extra groups from houston who generally attend the beach cleanups in galveston and surfside - now that's dedication to our beaches."" the memorial mustang outreach bunch (mmob) from memorial high school in houston was one of those groups - bringing about 160 students that would normally attend beach cleanups a little closer to home. another houston group that participated in the event in matagorda for the first time was the naval sea cadets. each year, many local organizations make the beach cleanup a success and this year was no different. local participants in the event included: lyondellbasell with more than 75 volunteers, bay city student council, oxea corp., bay city junior high spanish-science club, chevron phillips, lcra, christ episcopal church in matagorda, conocophillips, matagorda area chamber of commerce and the tidehaven science-spanish club. the texas landcruisers, an off-roading organization from houston, is another faithful participant that once again lent their time and effort to promote a clean, safe and healthy beach in matagorda. ""there were also several individuals from as far as north houston and lagrange,"" said stanley. each year the event begins with an early morning registration and then the volunteers spread out to sweep the beach clean for several hours. in the end, everyone meets back at the pavilion at jetty park to enjoy lunch, share their experiences and show off any treasures they may have found among the trash on the beach. the event also includes prizes in the form of a wal-mart gift card donated by oxea for unique accomplishments. this year's winners were: kristin and casey smith from houston for being pre-beach cleanup day volunteers who gave their time and efforts months before the actual date and participating at the cleanup; madison proske, a two-year-old from lagrange, for being the youngest volunteer; and robert nelson, with lyondellbasell, for being the first volunteer on the beach the day of the cleanup. six other volunteers were rewarded for their thoroughness and ""eagle eyes"" while combing the beach for litter when they found bottles that were planted on the beach containing a message to redeem for a gift card. tommy whittaker, romero montero, karson volkmer, fara ashcraft, lauren lev and rita wagner were the lucky winners of those prizes that ""were not easy to find."" although the beach was relatively clean this year, the volunteers collected about 12,500 pounds of garbage that filled nearly two dump trucks.",text,,,

2008110321_00008012_W,"global paradigms political and economic analysis tough tasks and challenges ahead for next us president business times - 04 nov 2008 by leon hadar washington correspondent in one of the famous scenes in the 1972 film the candidate, robert redford who has just won a race for a senate seat from california, surrounded by celebrating supporters during a victory party, pulls his press secretary into a room while throngs of journalists clamour outside, and then asks him: 'marvin. . . what do we do now?' it's quite clear that whoever wins this year's us presidential race today is not going to pose that question to his aide. instead, he is more likely to ask his adviser: 'what do we do first?' indeed, after confronting what amounts to be an existential threat to us national interests - a devastating economic crisis and two long and costly wars - the next occupant of the white house might end up wondering whether his victory in the 2008 presidential race was such a good news. for all practical purposes, the winner, even before he is inaugurated as the next president on jan 20, 2009, will be sucked immediately into perfect geo-strategic and economic storms. ask any good economist for an advice on how to contain the global financial crisis or discuss with any bright military strategist how the united states could win in iraq and/or afghanistan. in both cases the response would be very similar: 'i don't know.' and that is clearly not the kind of answer that the new president expects to get from his advisers during the most difficult presidential transition period since franklin d roosevelt was preparing to replace president herbert hoover, in the midst of the post-1929 financial crash and the ensuing great depression. just as americans are preparing to go to the polls today, the government reported that the us economy was officially in a recession after contracting from july through september. and it was also clear that the financial crisis was starting to affect the 'real economy'. consumer spending dipped for the first time in 17 years, and most economists expected the drop in economic activity to put added pressure on main street in the form of more bankruptcies, more layoffs and even less spending. more specifically, there are concerns that as credit card companies face a financial squeeze and continue raising their fees, consumers will further cut their spending to an all-time low, bringing economic activity to a near halt. it was a combination of the 'wealth effect' that resulted from a bullish stock market, the appreciating value of homes and the availability of credit cards that had driven the spend-like-crazy mood of the american consumers in the past two decades and provided the country's economy with its powerful engine. now that engine is dead, creating a vicious downward economic circle of falling housing prices, shrinking credit, falling business orders and rising layoffs and bankruptcies, that lead to more shrinking in consumer spending. as the new white house occupant deals with this depressing reality, he will realise the options available to him are few. the spread of the financial contagion to other parts of the world and the rise in the value of the us dollar make it difficult for the us economy to export its way out of the recession. that suggests that the next president would have no choice but to rely on fiscal policies, including huge increases in government spending, to try containing the crisis. and if the troubles in the economy are not enough, the new president will be facing a vast array of geo-strategic crises at a time when the us military is overstretched in costly wars in iraq and afghanistan and as congress is expected to press for major cuts in defence spending. 'after the new president-elect's excitement subsides after winning the election, it is going to be dampened somewhat when he begins to focus on the realities of the myriad challenges,' said mike mcconnell, the director of national intelligence, in a speech last week. in addition to the expected threats, 'there is always surprise', he added, noting that the first months of a new presidency are a 'period of most vulnerability', pointing out that terrorist attacks occurred during the first year of the administrations of george w bush and bill clinton. in addition, mr mcconnell and other experts expect that the new president will also have to deal with the challenge posed to us global supremacy by the increasing economic and military power of china, india and russia. and there is also a concern that the expanding global economic crisis combined with climate change could also exacerbate problems such as food shortages and civil unrest, and lead to more violence around the world, especially in sub-saharan africa and parts of latin america. in fact, when one considers it might be a mission impossible for anyone to resolve most of these problems, the next president may end up concluding that winning the election was actually the bad news.",text,,,

""the competition is greater, the pressures on kids have increased dramatically,"" said mel riddle of the national association of secondary school principals. ""they have opportunities their predecessors didn't have [to cheat]. the temptation is greater."" the josephson institute, a los angeles-based ethics institute, surveyed 29,760 students at 100 randomly selected high schools nationwide, both public and private. all students in the selected schools were given the survey in class; their anonymity was assured. michael josephson, the institute's founder and president, said he was most dismayed by the findings about theft. the survey found that 35 percent of boys and 26 percent of girls - 30 percent overall - acknowledged stealing from a store within the past year. one-fifth said they stole something from a friend; 23 percent said they stole something from a parent or other relative. ""what is the social cost of that - not to mention the implication for the next generation of mortgage brokers?"" josephson remarked in an interview. ""in a society drenched with cynicism, young people can look at it and say 'why shouldn't we? everyone else does it.'

the government insists that the ""availability of legal content in the forms that consumers want"" is actually the most important step content owners can take to address the problem. disconnection of users without a court order appears not to be on the table, either. in a stunning example of how drm comes back to bite the legitimate consumer in the proverbial backside, the pc game gears of war was rendered unplayable for legitimate owners on the 28th when the certificate used in the registration process expired. gamers who tried to play gears of war on the pc thursday ran into a slight snag: it seems that the digital certificate that allows the game to run expired on january 28, 2009. basically that means if you keep your pc's clock up to date, you can no longer play the game. the official epic forum is ablaze with complaints about this issue, as the still-kicking community becomes enraged. the popular 'glider' bot for world of warcraft was ruled to be a 'circumvention device' under the dmca and that the founder of the company who produced it was personally liable for the actions of the company. blizzard notched another victory in its legal campaign against world of warcraft bots when a judge on wednesday ruled that a leading bot violates the digital millennium copyright act. mdy industries llc, the firm that develops and sells the glider bot, already suffered a major setback last summer when the judge granted blizzard summary judgment on several key issues. this week's decision deals with the issues the judge believed could not be decided until the conclusion of this month's trial. the judge ruled that glider violated the dmca's ban on ""circumvention devices,"" and he also found that mdy's founder, michael donnelly, was personally liable for the actions of his firm. i would normally consider stories like this to be sensationalist, but it does include some interesting tidbits about the next generation of botnets. as notable as the sustained fall-off in spam levels has been, we've all known it's only a matter of time before botnets began to worm their way back into the the internet. it turns out that part of the reason spam levels may have stayed lower these past months is that the same authors who might have normally spent time resurrecting their dead botnets on new servers were instead writing new botnets altogether. the new malware networks aren't just rehashes of what's come before; many of them incorporate advanced techniques to render themselves harder to detect/remove. domain registrars are concerned about efforts by icann to determine what can be done about the use of fast flux hosting for illegal purposes. fast flux and double flux hosting present both registrars and registrants with a thorny problem. these two hosting methods are not classified as attack methods in and of themselves, but are often employed by spammers and malware botnets. us isp verizon have ""lost"" 3,400 database records pertaining to customers who chose to opt-out of their marketing campaign. verizon seems to have run into a glitch with one of its customer databases, losing thousands of records. here's the background: in compliance with federal communications commission rules, the company has established a system to permit consumers to ""opt out"" of letting verizon use their phone records for marketing campaigns. an irish isp has settled a court case with the music industry by agreeing to a graduated response plan to target repeat offenders in online piracy. one of ireland's largest isps, eircom, has capitulated to the major music labels and agreed to implement a full ""graduated response"" program-complete with disconnections. users get two warnings regarding file-sharing, and a third violation brings down the banhammer. the music industry has already said that it intends to pursue the same agreement with ireland's other isps. us isp cox is preparing to throttle ""non time-sensitive"" traffic across its network. it takes guts-or perhaps something a bit further down the anatomy-to wait until comcast has been smacked down for singling out p2p, the obama administration has come to power, and democrat michael copps (temporarily) heads the fcc to roll out a new internet traffic management system that delays only some kinds of content during moments of congestion. but that's exactly what cox cable, the third largest cable system in the us, has just announced. the british ""child protection database"", containing contact details for every under-18 year old in england will be accessible to 390,000 people, and parents will not be permitted to have their child removed from the database, it has been revealed. the contactpoint database is intended to improve information sharing between professionals working with children. children's minister baroness morgan said parents would not be allowed to remove their children from the list. the conservatives attacked the £224m database as ""another expensive data disaster waiting to happen"".","text, spam",sys msg,,

2009020104_00021661_W,"ottawa - ottawa's striking transit drivers, mechanics and dispatchers voted overwhelmingly saturday in favour of a plan for binding arbitration to settle the dispute. the margin was 95 per cent in favour, according to radio station cfra the vote followed ottawa city council's unanimous approval of the option early friday. company sources told cfra that mechanics began returning to work saturday to start getting buses ready for a return to service on thursday. the amalgamated transit union's international branch vice-president, randy graham, says his members were willing to keep garages open around the clock until service resumes. the agreement to let an arbitrator determine a contract came thursday, a day after the federal government said it was prepared to legislate an end to the nearly two-month strike. talks between the city and the union had reached an impasse after repeated breakdowns in negotiations. major issues in the dispute included wages and work schedules. a debate in the house of commons on the back-to-work legislation was cancelled after word of the deal was released. the strike had transformed tranquil ottawa into an urban jungle overnight. traffic chaos, road rage and overfilled parking lots became a fact of life around parliament hill. some shops were shuttered as employees suddenly stopped showing up for work, suburban customers couldn't reach the downtown core, and owners opted to stay home instead of commuting. getting a taxi was a herculean task during rush hour; calls to the major cab companies resulted in busy signals or - for the lucky few who managed to get through - prompted a warning that 90-minute waits had become the new normal. getting transportation was especially difficult during the recent cold snaps that hit the region, as the frenzied competition for cabs left many carless residents walking long distances in weather that plunged below -20c. labour minister rona ambrose said last wednesday the federal government was prepared to legislate and end to the strike, and there was word from the liberals and ndp they would support the move. liberal premier dalton mcguinty, who represents an ottawa riding, had pressed the federal government to act. red ken: artifact of a discarded ideology or the man of the future? close what are tags? a tag is a keyword or descriptive term supplied by our editorial staff used to associate related articles with one another. tags make it easier for you to find other stories that share the same theme or topic with the article you're currently reading. © copyright 2009 ctvglobemedia publishing inc. all rights reserved. the globe and mail are divisions of ctvglobemedia publishing inc.,",text,,,
2009020113_00022308_W,"nfl coverage hall call hits high note for bob hayes t ampa - the wait for recognition was so long in coming that the only thing left of ""bullet bob"" hayes by the time he was elected to the pro football hall of fame yesterday was a note. the dallas cowboys' explosive wide receiver was one of six men voted in as the class of 2009, joining buffalo bills defensive end bruce smith, bills founder ralph wilson, cornerback rod woodson, minnesota vikings 12-time pro bowl offensive guard randall mcdaniel and kansas city chiefs linebacker derrick thomas. smith, the game's all-time sack leader with 200, dissolved into tears when asked to talk about the honor, but his reaction paled in comparison to the moment lucille hester, hayes' sister, stood at a press conference and read a note from the man once known as the world's fastest human after he won the 100-meter gold medal at the 1964 olympics in tokyo. ""bob left a statement (before his death) in case this day came,"" she said before producing the brief note of thanks to the cowboys, his friends, family and supporters, his teammates, florida a&m (where he starred as a running back for legendary coach jake gaither) and ""especially everyone on the east side"" of jacksonville, fla., where he grew up. he ended the note by saying, ""thank everyone in the whole world."" hayes was a ground-breaking player whose commanding speed changed the way nfl teams played defense. unable to be covered one-on-one, hayes averaged 21.8 yards a catch, gained 1,003 yards and scored 12 touchdowns in his rookie season of 1965. by the end of his 11-year career, he scored 71 touchdowns, averaged 20 yards per catch and a touchdown every 5.2 receptions. he is still the holder of 10 regular-season cowboys receiving records 34 years after his 1975 retirement. ""i know one thing, and i played with him,"" hall of fame tight end mike ditka said. ""he changed the game. he made defenses and defensive coordinators work hard to figure out what you had to do to stop him."" hayes was in his 29th year of eligibility but was a hall of fame finalist for only the second time, his first as a senior candidate. although many in football insisted for years it was a travesty that hayes was not in the hall, his candidacy was for many years stymied by off-the-field legal and drug problems that led to his incarceration. smith spoke eloquently of how proud his father would have been were he alive, his eyes welling up in tears as he spoke. he was the polar opposite of hayes, entering the hall along with woodson in their first year of eligibility. he is not only is the all-time sacks leader but his 13 seasons with 10 or more sacks is an nfl record. ""bear with me as i gather myself together,"" smith said. ""i just had a moment . . . thinking about my father and all the sacrifices he and my mother made when i was a child. how he wanted me to have a life better than he had for himself. i just wish he was with me. he would have been proud."" smith went on to note his parents had worked hard at jobs they didn't enjoy for $2.35 an hour to raise him but always had time to take him to football and basketball practice growing up in norfolk, va. it was there that he began a football journey that ends aug. 8, in canton, ohio, when he is inducted along with the man he played for through 15 years and four consecutive trips to the super bowl. the 90-year-old wilson sat next to smith, seemingly shocked at his election even though he was not only one of the founders of the american football league but also a driving force behind the merger that created today's nfl and the massively popular super bowl. ""i don't know what to say but i know i've got to say something,"" wilson deadpanned. ""i never expected this. i came into this because i liked the game."" many consider wilson ""the conscience of the game"" for his refusal to abandon buffalo for a more lucrative market and his steadfast refusal to vote to approve franchise moves. ""a pro football team is not about making money. that may sound a little off the track, but it's not. even though buffalo is a receding economy and it's more difficult to operate (in) than other areas we can survive,"" wilson said. ""it would be crushing to the fans if they didn't have that team. ""i've voted against all relocations. all! i don't think it's right. i understand economic need but a sport, to me, is not just to make money."" sack master: bruce smith wipes his face as he discusses his election to the hall of fame yesterday in tampa. © copyright by the boston herald and herald media. no portion of bostonherald.com or its content may be reproduced without the owner's written permission.",text,,,

""it's having an effect on air travel,"" southwest ceo gary kelly told the associated press. ""the bookings this week have been erratic at best."" kelly didn't provide any numbers, but he said that as schools close - fort worth became the first large u.s. district to shut all its campuses - and large public events around the country are canceled to avoid spreading the virus, air traffic is likely to fall in the next couple weeks. continental said it will reduce flights to mexico by about 40 percent and use smaller planes but will continue flying to all 29 mexican cities it serves. it also extended its waiver policy to let customers with trips booked for mexico change itineraries without penalty by the end of may. the airline said the reductions will be temporary. continental was running an average of 450 flights a week to mexico, and the changes will cut its expected may capacity about 2 percent. ""we were already experiencing soft market conditions due to the economy, and now our mexico routes in particular have extra weakness,"" said larry kellner, continental's chairman and ceo. ""we consider it a very insignificant amount of their total capacity and their total revenues,"" said standard & poor's equity analyst jim corridore. if the main concern stays focused on mexico, swine flu shouldn't have a big impact on the u.s. airline industry, he said. ""i would expect that this would be a short-term issue,"" corridore added. health authorities have confirmed 15 swine-flu deaths in mexico and one in the u.s., a toddler from mexico who died this week in houston. there are more than 500 confirmed cases worldwide, including more than 300 in mexico and more than 100 in the u.s. the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention advised against nonessential travel to mexico, and european union officials advised their citizens to postpone nonessential travel to parts of mexico and the u.s. affected by swine flu. by early afternoon friday, continental was the only u.s. carrier to announce capacity cuts to mexico. ""we continue to monitor and evaluate the demand situation closely,"" said tim smith, a spokesman for american airlines, a unit of amr corp., the second-biggest u.s. carrier to mexico. delta air lines inc. spokeswoman betsy talton also said that carrier is monitoring the situation. a check by the associated press on wednesday showed that some flights from the united states to mexico had an unusually high number of empty seats. flights heading north appeared to be fuller. after a flap this week over comments by vice president joe biden, who said he told family members to avoid airplanes, transportation secretary ray lahood declared that air travel was safe and there was no reason to cancel flights. kelly, the ceo of dallas-based southwest, said air travel is safe but that his airline had instructed employees to be vigilant about washing hands, sanitizing aircraft and looking out for fellow workers or passengers who appeared ill. anyone who looks ill will be given a paper mask to wear during the flight, he said. subscribe to the news copyright 1999 - 2009 - the buffalo news copyright-protected material. © 2009 the buffalo news. the information you receive online from the buffalo news is protected by the copyright laws of the united states.",text,,,

2009063020_00040656_W,"class is in session with cris sykes and scott luzier as they get cleveland fans up to speed on all the local and national news and topics of the past ... today in cleveland sports history 1998: jim thome and kenny lofton were voted into the al's all-star starting lineup. 1997: charles nagy had the 1st regular season hit for a tribe pitcher. 1995: eddie murray collects

perez and a pla ... busy week for tony. wednesday, he was in mahoning valley, watching and talking with members of the scrappers. thursday, 2009 first round pick alex w ... time for some action the wheels are officially starting to fall off the wagon. the tribe has lost eight of nine, is now 30-44 on the season, and has the worst record in t ... the b-list: 6/24 carl pavano takes his turn on the comedy tour, giving up 11 hits and recording 11 outs and taking the loss. the tribe tried to make it interesting, b ... back in 2002 when indians owner larry dolan and general manager mark shapiro implemented ""the plan"", the idea was to build from within with a focus on ... carl pavano's first two innings were not much to write home about. the first was an exercise in autopedisurculum, in which pavano gave up a run on three balls that didn't leave the infield and a stolen base. the second was punctuated by the ridiculous sight of chris getz garnering an extra-base hit. in these two innings, pavano gave up two runs on four hits and didn't strike anyone out, requiring 33 pitches to record six outs (5 groundouts, 1 caught stealing). consider: pavano allowed exactly one baserunner on a single. he struck out 6 hitters in 5 innings, and 5 of the ks were swinging. 4 of the 5 innings were 1-2-3 affairs. and he required only 67 pitches to saw through those five innings (16 batters). there was a lot to like about this start: unlike several starts ago, when pavano was elevating the ball and paying for it, he had good movement on balls that dove low into (or dropping out of) the strike zone, keeping the white sox from making good contact (or, in the case of 6 of the 16 batters after the second, any contact) and producing an excellent 11:3 go:fo ratio. getz' double was the only extra-base hit, and it was more of a corner shot than anything threatening to go over the wall. two of the hits were caught by infielders. pavano had been rolling through a great stretch before his neck and shoulder began bothering him, possibly because this is the first time he's made three months of regular rotation turns in quite a while. after three poor outings against kansas city, milwaukee, and pittsburgh, pavano seems to have found his ""mound legs"" once again. and i'm not just saying this because i'm trying to incorporate the data i like at the expense of those i don't: they way that pavano got 11 ground ball outs and gave up 5 baserunners in 7 full innings (69 strikes in 100 pitches) was indicative of a guy getting back into synch. it's interesting: pavano somehow posts a weird home/away split, in which he's allowed opponents to hit .328 with a 6.38 era (7 homers in 42 1/3 innings) at home, while holding them to a more-palatable .279 average with a 4.86 era and 4 hr in 50 ip on the road. considering that 3 of those home runs came in his first two road starts, you could argue that pavano, in stadia other than not jacobs' field, has been a pretty good pitcher. consider: i know we've talked about this before, but that first start really skews things so horribly. but if you excise that start, pavano has made 8 road starts, pitching 49 innings and giving up 18 earned runs, only once yielding more than 3 earned runs. this translates into a road era of 3.31, with a whip of 1.20 and striking out 7.71 guys per 9 innings. you don't want to necessarily put a huge stock into 8 starts, but ... i mean, those are pretty good numbers. consider this: antonio bastardo has gone on the dl. brett myers is already there. the philadelphia rotation now consists of a guy older than me with a 6.05 era, a really fat guy with a 5.06 era, the ill-advised usage of chan ho park (5.94 era), and two lefties, one excellent (cole hamels) and one who has been more of a pleasant surprise (j.a. happ). the a.l. just completed another global waxing of the n.l. in interleague play. and carl pavano pitching anywhere besides cleveland has a 3.31 era after his opening disaster start. one other thing should be mentioned here: pavano has a 68:18 k:bb ratio, meaning he doesn't put extra guys on base very often. he's only given up one home run on the road since april 15 in 43 innings. and his last two starts show a real command of a sinker that is working very well, with 12:6 and 13:7 gb:fb ratios, something that would come in very handy in philadelphia, where fly balls turn into runs. th home run of the season off setup man octavio dotel, no small feat: dotel has a sharp 3.23 era and had only given up two home runs in 30 innings this season. dotel's whip is kind of high because he has taken the cleveland indians control correspondence course, walking 21 batters in 30 2/3 innings, but he strikes out 11.45 guys per nine innings and is an ex-closer, so he's got something on the ball. better yet, there were two outs at the time, so this was a last-gasp sort of blow that kept the game alive in the bottom of the ninth. of course, this was when the score was 6-1 and one runner was on base. when the score was 2-0 and three runners were on base, garko had possibly the worst plate appearance of all time. after walking two of the previous three batters and giving up a single to jhonny peralta on a 1-2 pitch after starting him 0-2, it was paramount that garko get a good pitch to hit. pavano may have had his sinker working, but floyd was simply otherwordly: peralta's lineout double play to center in the second was the only out recorded in the air. floyd struck out 5, but recorded a preposterous 16 ground ball outs for a 16:1 go:fo ratio. not get a good pitch to hit. he got a lousy pitch to hit, and he hit it lousily . now, i understand all the wailing and foofraw about how the umpires did not do a good job of officiating that play (garko's weak roller was picked up by floyd at the foul line: floyd threw him out, despite some argument over whether the ball was fair or foul. replays showed it was fair.). the umpires did not do a good job of officiating that play. but compared to garko's execution in the given circumstance, the umpires were ultimate super happy excellent professional standard-setting awesome umpires. that ""swing"" transcended ""piss-poor"" and moved to the little-used ""bile-encrusted feebleness."" what a debut! woot, there it is! chris perez in the hizzouse! derp, derp! 5) message (temporarily) received since being benched for being jhonny peralta, jhonny peralta has responded with 15 hits in his past 11 games, including 6 games with two hits. 3 of the hits were doubles, and two were home runs. he has also drawn 5 walks over that span, and has struck out only 5 times. this translates into a .348/.417/.558 line that is not only impressive for the raw hit count, but also for a semblance of power that has been missing from peralta's game for quite some time. look, is this definitely a new jhonny peralta, you betcha? of course not. this is the same old happy wanderer that we've seen since 2005. he's still jhonny peralta. you get these stretches, in which peralta is one of the most valuable guys on the team because of his ability to hit and play a up-spectrum defensive position, and you get stretches like ... well ... april, in which with a little more hard work and dedication, peralta would have elevated his game to ""worthless schmoe."" well, at least can we say that eric wedge got through to jhonny peralta for sure this time, once and for all? of course not. have i mentioned he's still jhonny peralta? he's still jhonny peralta. sometimes we forget he's still only 27 years old. and largely clueless. okay, actually, most of us don't really forget that, but no, this marks no significant state change in the relationship between the square-jawed master of no lips and the spherically-headed master of blank stares. well, then, can we say that at least this is indicative of the reason that jhonny peralta can be considered a net asset? sure, this we can say. we could ask him to be more consistent, but we could also ask for maple syrup to come out of the pipes of the guest bathroom. quantum mechanics tells us these things are possible, yet somehow, i am not holding my breath in anticipation of their eminent arrival. he seems to be playing better at third than i thought he would, although, admittedly, i thought that he would have been struck in the face by multiple line drives by this point in the season, so this is not an entirely-meaningful measuring stick. he's playing like a third baseman and hitting like a third baseman, and i'll take that for now. wedge really does need to invest in some lips, though. 6) speaking of struck by multiple line drives ... choo had a pair of hits last night, including a homer off a left-handed relief pitcher, matt thornton. this is good: choo is actually hitting lefties at a .244/.371/.397 clip, which is a big improvement over the perceived past. (actually, from 2006-2008, choo hit .276/.343/.408 against lefties: i'm not sure where he got this ""platoon guy"" tag, but it doesn't appear to have come from, y'know, anything like data.) anyway, that's good. except that he needed that homer to lift his june slg all the way to ... .418. with all the streakiness and collapsing and injuries and everything else, to this point, choo has been the one rock of steadiness. he hit .274/.409/.479 in april. he hit .311/.414/.472 in may. the average is different, but the obp and slg are virtually identical. in june, he is hitting .296, right in the middle of april and may, and his june obp of .395 is within sight of the low-.400s he was putting up before. in april, shoo had 9 extra-base hits: 6 doubles and 3 homers. in may, 8 xbh: 3 doubles, a triple, and 4 homers. in june, only 6 (3 doubles, 3 homers). these are not huge numbers, and you turn a couple singles into doubles and you wonder what my point is. but the trend is going the wrong way: hopefully, this is just a slow month for choo's power (you want small-sample discouragement, check out victor martinez' month-by-month batting averages). 8) welcome to the club, you'll fit right in! he hit the first hitter in the head. in all seriousness, all due wishes for a speedy and full recovery for alexei ramirez. very bad. he hit jermaine dye with a pitch that would have hit the shorter ramirez in the head again. very, he walked jim thome, but this is merely bad. a lot of people have walked jim thome. and then, on the inning-ending double play ball to first, perez ... did not cover first base. would this definitely have been a double play? i don't know about definitely. but it definitely was not a double play without perez covering the bag, and a run scored. and then he simply went insane, giving up a double to getz, a wild pitch, and a run-scoring single. and here's the kicker: had he covered first base and we had turned the double play ... we would have won the damn game 3-2! (okay, you can't technically say that: jenks may have come out, or dotel might have pitched more carefully, or what have you, but coming back from 2-0 is certainly a lit different from having to come back from 6-0.)
