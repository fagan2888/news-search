C	junoon performed last december at the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo, we were doing sound checks before the show at the oslo spectrum in norway. listening to her sing just from a few feet away, i was blown away by the power of melissa's voice and the unity of vibrations contained in it. she gave me goosebumps. later that evening al gore and the nobel peace prize gathering of hollywood stars and moguls, rock stars, king, queen, prince, princess of norway's, politicians, business leaders and environmentalists all agreed with my observation. melissa and i became friends and musical admirers and in january, this year, she invited me to her home to spend a couple of days in los angeles where we talked about many things. among them, love and unity and how they are universal themes running from rumi to the beatles. in both east and west its poetry and music which unites humanity rather than politics which aims to divide and demonize 'the other'. melissa and i also talked about the children of abraham: jesus, moses and muhammad and their common spirit of brotherhood and sacrifice. we sat with acoustic guitars and out of that intense talking and jamming came "ring the bells." ring the bells is a cry for peace and change in a world of war and chaos. our only guiding principle was to be passionate, truthful and sincere and to allow the universe to inspire us...and boy did the universe ever conspire to inspire! yes! please enter my 1 year subscription (10 issues) to ode magazine and bill me later at the low rate of only offer good for new subscribers only. offer good in u.s. only.
Q	1173	15	ring the bells.

T	il&p chief says guarantee will bring 'stability' - the irish times - wed, oct 01, 2008
C	 last updated: wednesday, october 1, 2008, 08:37 il&p chief says guarantee will bring 'stability' david labanyi the government's guarantee for all bank deposits will bring stability to the irish financial system, irish life & permanent chief executive denis casey said this morning. speaking on rte radio casey said: "this will bring stability to the irish financial system, which would bring stability to the irish economy". "the government have made it crystal clear that this guarantee is not a subsidy to the irish banking system. the irish taxpayer is not going to be exposed in this," casey said. the two-year guarantee applies to retail, commercial and interbank deposits and took effect yesterday. it covers up to €400 billion of liabilities. "we will pay the irish taxpayer for the privilege of using ireland's balance sheet to allow us to borrow internationally and the capital which is in banks, the equity capital, will absorb any losses which arise in our normal course of business lending," casey said. the move was taken late on monday after irish banking stocks came under severe pressure that day amid concerns over their difficulties securing funding. "the government has not guaranteed large corporate loans or large property loans that irish banks may have lent," casey said. 4 bill allows state to take stake in any financial institution given aid 5 irish bank shares rise sharply on government guarantee 1 bill allows state to take stake in any financial institution given aid 2 irish bank shares rise sharply on government guarantee 4 bill allows state to take stake in any financial institution given aid resultsis the $700 billion paulson plan an appropriate response to the current crisis? have your say on the us election at denis staunton's blog welcome the outstanding new insignia from opel , writes michael mcaleer , motoring editor a strict disciplinarian "who doesn't indulge his cubs", headmaster of blackrock college alan macginty also displays fierce loyalty towards his charges, both in the classroom and on the sports field, and an unshakable commitment to blackrock

T	bay city tribune
C	by heather menzies bay city tribune hurricane ike may have upset many aspects of life on the gulf coast, but it seems to have bolstered the resolve of over 300 volunteers who turned out for the annual fall adopt-a-beach cleanup on matagorda beach saturday, sept. 27. "it was overwhelming to see the dedication and support," said peggy stanley, matagorda adopt-a-beach coordinator. "we even had some extra groups from houston who generally attend the beach cleanups in galveston and surfside - now that's dedication to our beaches." the memorial mustang outreach bunch (mmob) from memorial high school in houston was one of those groups - bringing about 160 students that would normally attend beach cleanups a little closer to home. another houston group that participated in the event in matagorda for the first time was the naval sea cadets. each year, many local organizations make the beach cleanup a success and this year was no different. local participants in the event included: lyondellbasell with more than 75 volunteers, bay city student council, oxea corp., bay city junior high spanish-science club, chevron phillips, lcra, christ episcopal church in matagorda, conocophillips, matagorda area chamber of commerce and the tidehaven science-spanish club. the texas landcruisers, an off-roading organization from houston, is another faithful participant that once again lent their time and effort to promote a clean, safe and healthy beach in matagorda. "there were also several individuals from as far as north houston and lagrange," said stanley. each year the event begins with an early morning registration and then the volunteers spread out to sweep the beach clean for several hours. in the end, everyone meets back at the pavilion at jetty park to enjoy lunch, share their experiences and show off any treasures they may have found among the trash on the beach. the event also includes prizes in the form of a wal-mart gift card donated by oxea for unique accomplishments. this year's winners were: kristin and casey smith from houston for being pre-beach cleanup day volunteers who gave their time and efforts months before the actual date and participating at the cleanup; madison proske, a two-year-old from lagrange, for being the youngest volunteer; and robert nelson, with lyondellbasell, for being the first volunteer on the beach the day of the cleanup. six other volunteers were rewarded for their thoroughness and "eagle eyes" while combing the beach for litter when they found bottles that were planted on the beach containing a message to redeem for a gift card. tommy whittaker, romero montero, karson volkmer, fara ashcraft, lauren lev and rita wagner were the lucky winners of those prizes that "were not easy to find." although the beach was relatively clean this year, the volunteers collected about 12,500 pounds of garbage that filled nearly two dump trucks.

C	gone mild aging gracefully and dispensing wisdom from kansas city. neil young, breast cancer, and trout fishing american laundromat records has put together a compilation of women performing covers of neil young songs, and the proceeds are going to support casting for recovery , a charity which hosts retreats for breast cancer survivors where "the sport of fly-fishing is used to promote physical, emotional, and spiritual healing." the cd has already raised over $22,000. the founder of the label lost his mother to breast cancer in 2005 after a 6 year battle with breast cancer. i lost my mother to breast cancer this past summer after a mercifully short battle. i'm blessed, though, with many great breast cancer survivors in my life, including one who is going through treatment as i write this. these great women need and deserve support in their healing. even if it weren't a fantastic cause, this cd sounds great on its own merits. here's a track listing, including songs i love covered by artists some of whom i know and some of whom i've never heard: disk 1 1. heart of gold - tanya donelly 2. i am a child - britta phillips (luna) 3. comes a time - kate york 4. the needle and the damage done - lori mckenna 5. down by the river - jill sobule with john doe 6. burned - veruca salt 7. cowgirl in the sand - josie cotton 8. a man needs a maid - dala 9. ohio - darcie miner 10. everybody knows this is nowhere - carmen townsend disk 2 1. cinnamon girl - euro trash girl 2. i believe in you - julie peel 3. tell me why - luff 4. ohio - dala 5. helpless - elk city 6. only love can break your heart - amilia k. spicer 7. sugar mountain - louise post 8. powderfinger - the watson twins 9. like a hurricane - kristin hersh 10. old man - cindy wheeler (caulfield sisters) 11. walk on - heidi gluck (some girls)

T	global paradigms: tough tasks and challenges ahead for next us president
C	global paradigms political and economic analysis tough tasks and challenges ahead for next us president business times - 04 nov 2008 by leon hadar washington correspondent in one of the famous scenes in the 1972 film the candidate, robert redford who has just won a race for a senate seat from california, surrounded by celebrating supporters during a victory party, pulls his press secretary into a room while throngs of journalists clamour outside, and then asks him: 'marvin. . . what do we do now?' it's quite clear that whoever wins this year's us presidential race today is not going to pose that question to his aide. instead, he is more likely to ask his adviser: 'what do we do first?' indeed, after confronting what amounts to be an existential threat to us national interests - a devastating economic crisis and two long and costly wars - the next occupant of the white house might end up wondering whether his victory in the 2008 presidential race was such a good news. for all practical purposes, the winner, even before he is inaugurated as the next president on jan 20, 2009, will be sucked immediately into perfect geo-strategic and economic storms. ask any good economist for an advice on how to contain the global financial crisis or discuss with any bright military strategist how the united states could win in iraq and/or afghanistan. in both cases the response would be very similar: 'i don't know.' and that is clearly not the kind of answer that the new president expects to get from his advisers during the most difficult presidential transition period since franklin d roosevelt was preparing to replace president herbert hoover, in the midst of the post-1929 financial crash and the ensuing great depression. just as americans are preparing to go to the polls today, the government reported that the us economy was officially in a recession after contracting from july through september. and it was also clear that the financial crisis was starting to affect the 'real economy'. consumer spending dipped for the first time in 17 years, and most economists expected the drop in economic activity to put added pressure on main street in the form of more bankruptcies, more layoffs and even less spending. more specifically, there are concerns that as credit card companies face a financial squeeze and continue raising their fees, consumers will further cut their spending to an all-time low, bringing economic activity to a near halt. it was a combination of the 'wealth effect' that resulted from a bullish stock market, the appreciating value of homes and the availability of credit cards that had driven the spend-like-crazy mood of the american consumers in the past two decades and provided the country's economy with its powerful engine. now that engine is dead, creating a vicious downward economic circle of falling housing prices, shrinking credit, falling business orders and rising layoffs and bankruptcies, that lead to more shrinking in consumer spending. as the new white house occupant deals with this depressing reality, he will realise the options available to him are few. the spread of the financial contagion to other parts of the world and the rise in the value of the us dollar make it difficult for the us economy to export its way out of the recession. that suggests that the next president would have no choice but to rely on fiscal policies, including huge increases in government spending, to try containing the crisis. and if the troubles in the economy are not enough, the new president will be facing a vast array of geo-strategic crises at a time when the us military is overstretched in costly wars in iraq and afghanistan and as congress is expected to press for major cuts in defence spending. 'after the new president-elect's excitement subsides after winning the election, it is going to be dampened somewhat when he begins to focus on the realities of the myriad challenges,' said mike mcconnell, the director of national intelligence, in a speech last week. in addition to the expected threats, 'there is always surprise', he added, noting that the first months of a new presidency are a 'period of most vulnerability', pointing out that terrorist attacks occurred during the first year of the administrations of george w bush and bill clinton. in addition, mr mcconnell and other experts expect that the new president will also have to deal with the challenge posed to us global supremacy by the increasing economic and military power of china, india and russia. and there is also a concern that the expanding global economic crisis combined with climate change could also exacerbate problems such as food shortages and civil unrest, and lead to more violence around the world, especially in sub-saharan africa and parts of latin america. in fact, when one considers it might be a mission impossible for anyone to resolve most of these problems, the next president may end up concluding that winning the election was actually the bad news.

C	 balenciaga spring summer 2009 women paris , the balenciaga fashion designer, is very professional and he made in this season ( spring summer 2009 women ), a great innovative collection. the first part of the runway, they are wearing a short dress which on the top there is a fabric stretched from the plain middle to the end making some drapes. the clothes on the beginning are very plain without any prints on them. the colours are very smooth. there aren't curves on this clothes, they are very square. you can notice some jackets, differents ones, because they are very colored and brilliant, and the coulours change with the lights. they were made by uncommon cuts. and i say the same for the trousers. the men part is not different of the women. they were wearing suits with uncommon cuts and without curves. but you can notice they are still classics, but a little bit more contemporary. the second women's part, the runway goes to another way. it starts showing up some plain blouses, which are very clean but made by different cuts. the highlight of this part it is the trousers which have a very strange cut, with the black colour hidden by superimposition. and then the dresses start to show up. they have curves and frills now. they are very colored and brilliant as i said before about the jackets. and they have sleeves stuck to the arms, with different fabrics without any brightness. possibly related posts: (automatically generated)

T	study paints dismal portrait of high school students' ethics | top stories | star-telegram.com
C	 new york - in the past year, 30 percent of u.s. high school students have stolen from a store, and 64 percent have cheated on a test, according to a new, large-scale survey suggesting that americans are too apathetic about ethical standards. educators reacting to the findings questioned any suggestion that today's young people are less honest than previous generations, but several agreed that intensified pressures are prompting many students to cut corners. "the competition is greater, the pressures on kids have increased dramatically," said mel riddle of the national association of secondary school principals. "they have opportunities their predecessors didn't have [to cheat]. the temptation is greater." the josephson institute, a los angeles-based ethics institute, surveyed 29,760 students at 100 randomly selected high schools nationwide, both public and private. all students in the selected schools were given the survey in class; their anonymity was assured. michael josephson, the institute's founder and president, said he was most dismayed by the findings about theft. the survey found that 35 percent of boys and 26 percent of girls - 30 percent overall - acknowledged stealing from a store within the past year. one-fifth said they stole something from a friend; 23 percent said they stole something from a parent or other relative. "what is the social cost of that - not to mention the implication for the next generation of mortgage brokers?" josephson remarked in an interview. "in a society drenched with cynicism, young people can look at it and say 'why shouldn't we? everyone else does it.' " in the survey, 93 percent of the students said they were satisfied with their personal ethics and character, and 77 percent affirmed that "when it comes to doing what is right, i am better than most people i know." nijmie dzurinko, executive director of the philadelphia student union, said the findings were not at all reflective of the inner-city students she works with as an advocate for better curriculum and school funding. peter anderson, principal of andover high school in andover, mass., said he and his colleagues had detected very little cheating on tests or internet-based plagiarism. he has, however, noticed an uptick in students sharing homework in unauthorized ways. dishonest habits in a recent survey, more than 1 in 3 boys and one-fourth of girls admitted to stealing from a store within the past year. admitted stealing from a store in the last year: boys: 35% girls: 26% sometimes lied to save money: had cheated on a test: 2006: 60%

T	india surprised by bombay attacks? - kevin d. williamson - the media blog on national review online
C	india surprised by bombay attacks? [kevin d. williamson] goods: our coastal areas are coming under increased threat from terrorist groups, which have decided to use the sea route to infiltrate into india. they also plan to induct arms and ammunition through the sea routes" - that is shivraj patil addressing the directors general and inspectors general of police in november 2006. "we understand they (the terrorists) have been collecting information regarding location of various refineries on or near the indian coastline... some lashkar-e-taiba (let) operatives are also being trained specifically for sabotage of oil installations. there are plans to occupy some uninhabited islands off the country's coastline to use them as bases for launching operations on the indian coast..." that was the ever-alert home minister in november 2006. ... on november 22, 2008, that is literally on the eve of the attacks in mumbai, he told the police chiefs, "to control terrorism in the hinterland, we have to see that infiltration of terrorists from other countries does not take place through the sea routes and through the borders between india and friendly countries. the coastlines also have to be guarded through navy, coast guard and coastal police. the states' special branches and the cid should identify the persons forming part of the sleeper cells and lodging in cities and towns and studying in educational institutions and working in industries and professions..." and four days later, the terrorists, using the exact same sea route, do the exact same thing that these worthies have been warning others about. are they consultants to government or ones running the government? is their job to issue warnings to others or to see that the warnings are acted upon? warning given, the job is done. but that is the fate of warnings in this system. after all, that very sea route was used to smuggle explosives for the blasts across bombay in 1993. were those blasts not warning enough? familiar? perhaps this from richard miniter rings a bell: one of the big myths about the clinton years is that no one knew about bin laden until sept. 11, 2001. in fact, the bin laden threat was recognized at the highest levels of the clinton administration as early as 1993. what's more, bin laden's attacks kept escalating throughout the clinton administration; all told bin laden was responsible for the deaths of 59 americans on clinton's watch. president clinton learned about bin laden within months of being sworn into office. national security advisor anthony lake told me that he first heard the name osama bin laden in 1993 in relation to the world trade center attack. lake briefed the president about bin laden that same year. in addition, starting in 1993, rep. bill mccollum (r., fla.) repeatedly wrote to president clinton and warned him and other administration officials about bin laden and other islamic terrorists. mccollum was the founder and chairman of the house taskforce on terrorism and unconventional warfare and had developed a wealth of contacts among the mujihedeen in afghanistan. those sources, who regularly visited mccollum, informed him about bin laden's training camps and evil ambitions.

C	 profile ) thursday, january 1st at 2:38am est no comments i agree with the legal conclusions drawn in here), but that's not why i am linking to the article. rather, i am linking to it because it is necessary and important to keep the following firmly in mind concerning the illinois state statute that allows the governor to appoint a senator in the event of a vacancy: the chicago democrats in charge had the opportunity to change this statute, but did not do so because they fear the same thing i anticipate - namely, losing the seat. that fear should not be rewarded by deferring to their desired appointer (pat quinn); their fear should be spotlighted. precisely. a lot of democrats are congratulating themselves over the fact that they are taking rod blagojevich to the woodshed rhetorically, and implying that republicans do not police other republicans as effectively. those bouts of self-adulation would be more believable if there was a scintilla of outrage over the fact that illinois democrats, when given the chance to change the statute in springfield, refused to do so because they were worried that they might lose the seat in a special election.

the government insists that the "availability of legal content in the forms that consumers want" is actually the most important step content owners can take to address the problem. disconnection of users without a court order appears not to be on the table, either. in a stunning example of how drm comes back to bite the legitimate consumer in the proverbial backside, the pc game gears of war was rendered unplayable for legitimate owners on the 28th when the certificate used in the registration process expired. gamers who tried to play gears of war on the pc thursday ran into a slight snag: it seems that the digital certificate that allows the game to run expired on january 28, 2009. basically that means if you keep your pc's clock up to date, you can no longer play the game. the official epic forum is ablaze with complaints about this issue, as the still-kicking community becomes enraged. the popular 'glider' bot for world of warcraft was ruled to be a 'circumvention device' under the dmca and that the founder of the company who produced it was personally liable for the actions of the company. blizzard notched another victory in its legal campaign against world of warcraft bots when a judge on wednesday ruled that a leading bot violates the digital millennium copyright act. mdy industries llc, the firm that develops and sells the glider bot, already suffered a major setback last summer when the judge granted blizzard summary judgment on several key issues. this week's decision deals with the issues the judge believed could not be decided until the conclusion of this month's trial. the judge ruled that glider violated the dmca's ban on "circumvention devices," and he also found that mdy's founder, michael donnelly, was personally liable for the actions of his firm. i would normally consider stories like this to be sensationalist, but it does include some interesting tidbits about the next generation of botnets. as notable as the sustained fall-off in spam levels has been, we've all known it's only a matter of time before botnets began to worm their way back into the the internet. it turns out that part of the reason spam levels may have stayed lower these past months is that the same authors who might have normally spent time resurrecting their dead botnets on new servers were instead writing new botnets altogether. the new malware networks aren't just rehashes of what's come before; many of them incorporate advanced techniques to render themselves harder to detect/remove. domain registrars are concerned about efforts by icann to determine what can be done about the use of fast flux hosting for illegal purposes. fast flux and double flux hosting present both registrars and registrants with a thorny problem. these two hosting methods are not classified as attack methods in and of themselves, but are often employed by spammers and malware botnets. us isp verizon have "lost" 3,400 database records pertaining to customers who chose to opt-out of their marketing campaign. verizon seems to have run into a glitch with one of its customer databases, losing thousands of records. here's the background: in compliance with federal communications commission rules, the company has established a system to permit consumers to "opt out" of letting verizon use their phone records for marketing campaigns. an irish isp has settled a court case with the music industry by agreeing to a graduated response plan to target repeat offenders in online piracy. one of ireland's largest isps, eircom, has capitulated to the major music labels and agreed to implement a full "graduated response" program-complete with disconnections. users get two warnings regarding file-sharing, and a third violation brings down the banhammer. the music industry has already said that it intends to pursue the same agreement with ireland's other isps. us isp cox is preparing to throttle "non time-sensitive" traffic across its network. it takes guts-or perhaps something a bit further down the anatomy-to wait until comcast has been smacked down for singling out p2p, the obama administration has come to power, and democrat michael copps (temporarily) heads the fcc to roll out a new internet traffic management system that delays only some kinds of content during moments of congestion. but that's exactly what cox cable, the third largest cable system in the us, has just announced. the british "child protection database", containing contact details for every under-18 year old in england will be accessible to 390,000 people, and parents will not be permitted to have their child removed from the database, it has been revealed. the contactpoint database is intended to improve information sharing between professionals working with children. children's minister baroness morgan said parents would not be allowed to remove their children from the list. the conservatives attacked the £224m database as "another expensive data disaster waiting to happen".

C	constitution 101 by gary a mcavin at 7:17 pm on 11/26/2008 posted by gary a mcavin on tuesday, january 15, 2008 10:25:43 am shades of the ole south; we have a return to the middle 1800's before the slaves were set free. remember when president abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation? you know the document that freed the slaves from bondage and servitude? oh; you never heard of such a thing? my, my, have you lived a sheltered life. actually; there is the old school of thought still being utilized by hard core slaver mentalities. they never really believed that the black people were freed from slavery, theirs. and such throw backs to slaver antiquities still exist in the minds of many to this very day! to behold the condescending arrogant presentation of the clinton campaign harkens back to such a time and attitude. you see; the clinton's are the plantation masters and barrack obama is the runaway slave that refuses to remain on the master's plantation. and now he must be disciplined and scourged. he must be taught to know his place among them there white folks. remember martin luther king? just like abraham lincoln, he was assassinated for rising up against these plantation masters. and such will be the case for any uppity negro-aka african-american; that has the unmitigated gall to rise above their upbringing… have mercy! if you just pay attention to the words coming forth from hillary clinton's oral fissure you will most certainly hear the true condescending racist attitude of her slaver mentality. here is one of the controversial quotes ill-spoken from hillary clinton: "i would point to the fact that that dr. king's dream began to be realized when president johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964, when he was able to get through congress something that president kennedy was hopeful to do, the president before had not even tried, but it took a president to get it done." what is the veiled reference or inference here? is it not that dr. martin luther king was incapable of getting the job done? was she referring to lbj as being the major instrument for dr. king's righteous cause? the civil rights movement began at ground level. where was lbj at the time? was he marching and working with dr king directly? where was lbj (lyndon baines johnson) on brown v. board of education (1954)? where was lbj on the emmett till case (1955)? was lbj ever in alabama marching and going to jail for the cause with dr. king? was that great civil rights proponent lbj at any of the civil rights movements efforts, marches, and protests for/on equality? don't make me laugh. anything that lbj ever did for the civil rights movement was only for political expediency; his own!
Q	1614	307	i would point to the fact that that dr. king's dream began to be realized when president johnson passed the civil rights act of 1964, when he was able to get through congress something that president kennedy was hopeful to do, the president before had not even tried, but it took a president to get it done.

T	globeandmail.com: ottawa transit drivers agree to binding arbitration
C	 ottawa - ottawa's striking transit drivers, mechanics and dispatchers voted overwhelmingly saturday in favour of a plan for binding arbitration to settle the dispute. the margin was 95 per cent in favour, according to radio station cfra the vote followed ottawa city council's unanimous approval of the option early friday. company sources told cfra that mechanics began returning to work saturday to start getting buses ready for a return to service on thursday. the amalgamated transit union's international branch vice-president, randy graham, says his members were willing to keep garages open around the clock until service resumes. the agreement to let an arbitrator determine a contract came thursday, a day after the federal government said it was prepared to legislate an end to the nearly two-month strike. talks between the city and the union had reached an impasse after repeated breakdowns in negotiations. major issues in the dispute included wages and work schedules. a debate in the house of commons on the back-to-work legislation was cancelled after word of the deal was released. the strike had transformed tranquil ottawa into an urban jungle overnight. traffic chaos, road rage and overfilled parking lots became a fact of life around parliament hill. some shops were shuttered as employees suddenly stopped showing up for work, suburban customers couldn't reach the downtown core, and owners opted to stay home instead of commuting. getting a taxi was a herculean task during rush hour; calls to the major cab companies resulted in busy signals or - for the lucky few who managed to get through - prompted a warning that 90-minute waits had become the new normal. getting transportation was especially difficult during the recent cold snaps that hit the region, as the frenzied competition for cabs left many carless residents walking long distances in weather that plunged below -20c. labour minister rona ambrose said last wednesday the federal government was prepared to legislate and end to the strike, and there was word from the liberals and ndp they would support the move. liberal premier dalton mcguinty, who represents an ottawa riding, had pressed the federal government to act. red ken: artifact of a discarded ideology or the man of the future? close what are tags? a tag is a keyword or descriptive term supplied by our editorial staff used to associate related articles with one another. tags make it easier for you to find other stories that share the same theme or topic with the article you're currently reading. © copyright 2009 ctvglobemedia publishing inc. all rights reserved. the globe and mail are divisions of ctvglobemedia publishing inc.,

T	hall call hits high note for bob hayes - bostonherald.com
C	nfl coverage hall call hits high note for bob hayes t ampa - the wait for recognition was so long in coming that the only thing left of "bullet bob" hayes by the time he was elected to the pro football hall of fame yesterday was a note. the dallas cowboys' explosive wide receiver was one of six men voted in as the class of 2009, joining buffalo bills defensive end bruce smith, bills founder ralph wilson, cornerback rod woodson, minnesota vikings 12-time pro bowl offensive guard randall mcdaniel and kansas city chiefs linebacker derrick thomas. smith, the game's all-time sack leader with 200, dissolved into tears when asked to talk about the honor, but his reaction paled in comparison to the moment lucille hester, hayes' sister, stood at a press conference and read a note from the man once known as the world's fastest human after he won the 100-meter gold medal at the 1964 olympics in tokyo. "bob left a statement (before his death) in case this day came," she said before producing the brief note of thanks to the cowboys, his friends, family and supporters, his teammates, florida a&m (where he starred as a running back for legendary coach jake gaither) and "especially everyone on the east side" of jacksonville, fla., where he grew up. he ended the note by saying, "thank everyone in the whole world." hayes was a ground-breaking player whose commanding speed changed the way nfl teams played defense. unable to be covered one-on-one, hayes averaged 21.8 yards a catch, gained 1,003 yards and scored 12 touchdowns in his rookie season of 1965. by the end of his 11-year career, he scored 71 touchdowns, averaged 20 yards per catch and a touchdown every 5.2 receptions. he is still the holder of 10 regular-season cowboys receiving records 34 years after his 1975 retirement. "i know one thing, and i played with him," hall of fame tight end mike ditka said. "he changed the game. he made defenses and defensive coordinators work hard to figure out what you had to do to stop him." hayes was in his 29th year of eligibility but was a hall of fame finalist for only the second time, his first as a senior candidate. although many in football insisted for years it was a travesty that hayes was not in the hall, his candidacy was for many years stymied by off-the-field legal and drug problems that led to his incarceration. smith spoke eloquently of how proud his father would have been were he alive, his eyes welling up in tears as he spoke. he was the polar opposite of hayes, entering the hall along with woodson in their first year of eligibility. he is not only is the all-time sacks leader but his 13 seasons with 10 or more sacks is an nfl record. "bear with me as i gather myself together," smith said. "i just had a moment . . . thinking about my father and all the sacrifices he and my mother made when i was a child. how he wanted me to have a life better than he had for himself. i just wish he was with me. he would have been proud." smith went on to note his parents had worked hard at jobs they didn't enjoy for $2.35 an hour to raise him but always had time to take him to football and basketball practice growing up in norfolk, va. it was there that he began a football journey that ends aug. 8, in canton, ohio, when he is inducted along with the man he played for through 15 years and four consecutive trips to the super bowl. the 90-year-old wilson sat next to smith, seemingly shocked at his election even though he was not only one of the founders of the american football league but also a driving force behind the merger that created today's nfl and the massively popular super bowl. "i don't know what to say but i know i've got to say something," wilson deadpanned. "i never expected this. i came into this because i liked the game." many consider wilson "the conscience of the game" for his refusal to abandon buffalo for a more lucrative market and his steadfast refusal to vote to approve franchise moves. "a pro football team is not about making money. that may sound a little off the track, but it's not. even though buffalo is a receding economy and it's more difficult to operate (in) than other areas we can survive," wilson said. "it would be crushing to the fans if they didn't have that team. "i've voted against all relocations. all! i don't think it's right. i understand economic need but a sport, to me, is not just to make money." sack master: bruce smith wipes his face as he discusses his election to the hall of fame yesterday in tampa. © copyright by the boston herald and herald media. no portion of bostonherald.com or its content may be reproduced without the owner's written permission.

C	 gender : female status : single age : 18 sign : gemini city : cleveland hts. little johnny was sitting in class doing math problems when his teacher picked him to answer a question. "johnny, if there were five birds sitting on a fence and you shot one with your gun, how many would be left?" "none.", replied johnny "cause the rest would fly away." "well, the answer is four," said the teacher. "but i like the way you are thinking." little johnny said, "i have a question for you now. if there were three women eating ice cream cones in a shop, one licking her cone, the second biting her cone, and the third sucking the cone, which one is married?" "well," said the teacher nervously, "i guess the one sucking the cone?" "no," said little johnny, "the one with the wedding ring on her finger, but i like the way you are thinking." .................................................................. little johnny is sitting, being his cool self in the local park. along comes suzi chomping on her piece of gum. "hey johnny, wanna play doctor?" johnny lets out a puff of smoke, "nah, that's too old fashioned." johnny takes another drag, "spit out your gum, i wanna play president." ...................................................................................... little johnny applied for a salesman's job at a big department store. in fact it was the biggest store in the world - you could get anything there. the boss asked him, "have you ever been a salesman before?" "no, this is my first job," said the lad, but the boss liked the cut of him and said, "you can start tomorrow and i'll come and see you when we close up." the day was long and arduous for the young man, but finally 5 o'clock came around. the boss duly fronted up and asked, "how many sales did you make today?"

T	myspace.com blogs - more of john... with cool links! - john lennon tribute myspace blog
C	 about a week ago, i got bored and decided to watch a vhs tape i picked up about a year ago from a church rummage sale for $1. it was john lennon's "imagine, the definitive film portrait". i cannot believe i had this tape for this long and had never watched it. i was mesmerized. when it ended with the story of john's death, i cried and wondered what it would be like if john hadn't died when he did. when i woke up the next morning, the memory of the video was still with me and after turning on the tv, wasn't at all surprised to hear a report that yoko ono is campaigning for a national holiday to be established honoring john, to be set for october 9th, each year - his birthday. i think this is a fantastic idea. please go to this site to read about this proposed holiday and be sure to sign the petition to help make it so! -> december 8th is the 26th anniversary of john's death. i have never forgotten this date. every december, i remember john and the rest of the beatles with love and gratefulness for all that they've been in my life. i grew up with the beatles. i was only in elementary school when they first burst on the music scene. they simply became a way of life throughout my school years, a staple. just something that was an everyday part of life. i remember very vividly that whole period when they broke up. the final split was right around the time that the movie "let it be" came out, although anyone who lived through that time remembers that it was building long before that. i remember making my mother take me to see the movie as soon as it came out. i wouldn't take no for an answer. i cried and cried... for months over their break-up... and again after john's death. i couldn't believe he was really gone.. i still can't believe it. now there's a new dvd to be released july 6, 2007 (the 50th anniversary of john and paul first meeting). you can request to be notified by email when it's released here -> see the official john lennon site, courtesy of yoko ono here -> there is also a museum that opened october 9, 2000 in saitama, japan. again, note the significance of the date.. his birthday. you can see the official museum site here -> john and his message will live on in our hearts forever. if only he were here now.. can you imagine the power he could bring? here's a really great tribute in pictures: lisa's john & yoko slideshow be sure to check this one out, too. although i've notice that i signed the petition for the john lennon day! thanks for showing me, i feel so glad i could help! he deserves more than one holiday though...

T	the west virginia rebel's blog: paranoia will destroy you
C	 a.l. adds his voice to those calling the gop out on its supposed opposition: it's not a debate about socialism vs. capitalism; it's a debate about methods of damage control. but many conservatives have so deluded themselves with their own propaganda that they're not even capable of following the conversation any more. so instead they spend all day indulging in paranoid delusions and debates that have no relevance to current events. it's a sad spectacle. when all you have left is "just say no" and dumb political stunts like fake or nonexistent budget "alternatives," you've pretty much lost the argument. maybe someday they can learn how to win it again without looking like jackasses, but that will take time.

T	continental halves number of seats to mexico : world & nation : the buffalo news
C	 in this jan. 30, 2009 file photo, a continental airlines jet is wheeled on the tarmac at houston's george bush intercontinental airport. continental airlines, the biggest u.s. carrier to mexico, said friday, may 1, 2009, it will cut in half the number of seats it sells to fly there, as swine flu fear keeps travelers at home."> in this jan. 30, 2009 file photo, a continental airlines jet is wheeled on the tarmac at houston's george bush intercontinental airport. continental airlines, the biggest u.s. carrier to mexico, said friday, may 1, 2009, it will cut in half the number of seats it sells to fly there, as swine flu fear keeps travelers at home. continental airlines, the biggest u.s. carrier to mexico, said friday it will cut in half the number of seats it sells to fly there, as swine flu fear keeps travelers at home. continental's schedule reductions begin monday. the houston-based airline said it will work with travelers to get them where they need to go, although schedules and routes might change. southwest airlines co. doesn't fly to mexico, but its chief executive said bookings in the past week have dropped in response to concern about flying. "it's having an effect on air travel," southwest ceo gary kelly told the associated press. "the bookings this week have been erratic at best." kelly didn't provide any numbers, but he said that as schools close - fort worth became the first large u.s. district to shut all its campuses - and large public events around the country are canceled to avoid spreading the virus, air traffic is likely to fall in the next couple weeks. continental said it will reduce flights to mexico by about 40 percent and use smaller planes but will continue flying to all 29 mexican cities it serves. it also extended its waiver policy to let customers with trips booked for mexico change itineraries without penalty by the end of may. the airline said the reductions will be temporary. continental was running an average of 450 flights a week to mexico, and the changes will cut its expected may capacity about 2 percent. "we were already experiencing soft market conditions due to the economy, and now our mexico routes in particular have extra weakness," said larry kellner, continental's chairman and ceo. "we consider it a very insignificant amount of their total capacity and their total revenues," said standard & poor's equity analyst jim corridore. if the main concern stays focused on mexico, swine flu shouldn't have a big impact on the u.s. airline industry, he said. "i would expect that this would be a short-term issue," corridore added. health authorities have confirmed 15 swine-flu deaths in mexico and one in the u.s., a toddler from mexico who died this week in houston. there are more than 500 confirmed cases worldwide, including more than 300 in mexico and more than 100 in the u.s. the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention advised against nonessential travel to mexico, and european union officials advised their citizens to postpone nonessential travel to parts of mexico and the u.s. affected by swine flu. by early afternoon friday, continental was the only u.s. carrier to announce capacity cuts to mexico. "we continue to monitor and evaluate the demand situation closely," said tim smith, a spokesman for american airlines, a unit of amr corp., the second-biggest u.s. carrier to mexico. delta air lines inc. spokeswoman betsy talton also said that carrier is monitoring the situation. a check by the associated press on wednesday showed that some flights from the united states to mexico had an unusually high number of empty seats. flights heading north appeared to be fuller. after a flap this week over comments by vice president joe biden, who said he told family members to avoid airplanes, transportation secretary ray lahood declared that air travel was safe and there was no reason to cancel flights. kelly, the ceo of dallas-based southwest, said air travel is safe but that his airline had instructed employees to be vigilant about washing hands, sanitizing aircraft and looking out for fellow workers or passengers who appeared ill. anyone who looks ill will be given a paper mask to wear during the flight, he said. subscribe to the news copyright 1999 - 2009 - the buffalo news copyright-protected material. © 2009 the buffalo news. the information you receive online from the buffalo news is protected by the copyright laws of the united states.

(videodrive imports these files too, but the file information is not editable afterwards) anonymous that is exactly what i was aiming for. thanks ;)

and recording 11 outs and taking the loss. the tribe tried to make it interesting, b ... back in 2002 when indians owner larry dolan and general manager mark shapiro implemented "the plan", the idea was to build from within with a focus on ... carl pavano's first two innings were not much to write home about. the first was an exercise in autopedisurculum, in which pavano gave up a run on three balls that didn't leave the infield and a stolen base. the second was punctuated by the ridiculous sight of chris getz garnering an extra-base hit. in these two innings, pavano gave up two runs on four hits and didn't strike anyone out, requiring 33 pitches to record six outs (5 groundouts, 1 caught stealing). consider: pavano allowed exactly one baserunner on a single. he struck out 6 hitters in 5 innings, and 5 of the ks were swinging. 4 of the 5 innings were 1-2-3 affairs. and he required only 67 pitches to saw through those five innings (16 batters). there was a lot to like about this start: unlike several starts ago, when pavano was elevating the ball and paying for it, he had good movement on balls that dove low into (or dropping out of) the strike zone, keeping the white sox from making good contact (or, in the case of 6 of the 16 batters after the second, any contact) and producing an excellent 11:3 go:fo ratio. getz' double was the only extra-base hit, and it was more of a corner shot than anything threatening to go over the wall. two of the hits were caught by infielders. pavano had been rolling through a great stretch before his neck and shoulder began bothering him, possibly because this is the first time he's made three months of regular rotation turns in quite a while. after three poor outings against kansas city, milwaukee, and pittsburgh, pavano seems to have found his "mound legs" once again. and i'm not just saying this because i'm trying to incorporate the data i like at the expense of those i don't: they way that pavano got 11 ground ball outs and gave up 5 baserunners in 7 full innings (69 strikes in 100 pitches) was indicative of a guy getting back into synch. it's interesting: pavano somehow posts a weird home/away split, in which he's allowed opponents to hit .328 with a 6.38 era (7 homers in 42 1/3 innings) at home, while holding them to a more-palatable .279 average with a 4.86 era and 4 hr in 50 ip on the road. considering that 3 of those home runs came in his first two road starts, you could argue that pavano, in stadia other than not jacobs' field, has been a pretty good pitcher. consider: i know we've talked about this before, but that first start really skews things so horribly. but if you excise that start, pavano has made 8 road starts, pitching 49 innings and giving up 18 earned runs, only once yielding more than 3 earned runs. this translates into a road era of 3.31, with a whip of 1.20 and striking out 7.71 guys per 9 innings. you don't want to necessarily put a huge stock into 8 starts, but ... i mean, those are pretty good numbers. consider this: antonio bastardo has gone on the dl. brett myers is already there. the philadelphia rotation now consists of a guy older than me with a 6.05 era, a really fat guy with a 5.06 era, the ill-advised usage of chan ho park (5.94 era), and two lefties, one excellent (cole hamels) and one who has been more of a pleasant surprise (j.a. happ). the a.l. just completed another global waxing of the n.l. in interleague play. and carl pavano pitching anywhere besides cleveland has a 3.31 era after his opening disaster start. one other thing should be mentioned here: pavano has a 68:18 k:bb ratio, meaning he doesn't put extra guys on base very often. he's only given up one home run on the road since april 15 in 43 innings. and his last two starts show a real command of a sinker that is working very well, with 12:6 and 13:7 gb:fb ratios, something that would come in very handy in philadelphia, where fly balls turn into runs. th home run of the season off setup man octavio dotel, no small feat: dotel has a sharp 3.23 era and had only given up two home runs in 30 innings this season. dotel's whip is kind of high because he has taken the cleveland indians control correspondence course, walking 21 batters in 30 2/3 innings, but he strikes out 11.45 guys per nine innings and is an ex-closer, so he's got something on the ball. better yet, there were two outs at the time, so this was a last-gasp sort of blow that kept the game alive in the bottom of the ninth. of course, this was when the score was 6-1 and one runner was on base. when the score was 2-0 and three runners were on base, garko had possibly the worst plate appearance of all time. after walking two of the previous three batters and giving up a single to jhonny peralta on a 1-2 pitch after starting him 0-2, it was paramount that garko get a good pitch to hit. pavano may have had his sinker working, but floyd was simply otherwordly: peralta's lineout double play to center in the second was the only out recorded in the air. floyd struck out 5, but recorded a preposterous 16 ground ball outs for a 16:1 go:fo ratio. not get a good pitch to hit. he got a lousy pitch to hit, and he hit it lousily . now, i understand all the wailing and foofraw about how the umpires did not do a good job of officiating that play (garko's weak roller was picked up by floyd at the foul line: floyd threw him out, despite some argument over whether the ball was fair or foul. replays showed it was fair.). the umpires did not do a good job of officiating that play. but compared to garko's execution in the given circumstance, the umpires were ultimate super happy excellent professional standard-setting awesome umpires. that "swing" transcended "piss-poor" and moved to the little-used "bile-encrusted feebleness." what a debut! woot, there it is! chris perez in the hizzouse! derp, derp! 5) message (temporarily) received since being benched for being jhonny peralta, jhonny peralta has responded with 15 hits in his past 11 games, including 6 games with two hits. 3 of the hits were doubles, and two were home runs. he has also drawn 5 walks over that span, and has struck out only 5 times. this translates into a .348/.417/.558 line that is not only impressive for the raw hit count, but also for a semblance of power that has been missing from peralta's game for quite some time. look, is this definitely a new jhonny peralta, you betcha? of course not. this is the same old happy wanderer that we've seen since 2005. he's still jhonny peralta. you get these stretches, in which peralta is one of the most valuable guys on the team because of his ability to hit and play a up-spectrum defensive position, and you get stretches like ... well ... april, in which with a little more hard work and dedication, peralta would have elevated his game to "worthless schmoe." well, at least can we say that eric wedge got through to jhonny peralta for sure this time, once and for all? of course not. have i mentioned he's still jhonny peralta? he's still jhonny peralta. sometimes we forget he's still only 27 years old. and largely clueless. okay, actually, most of us don't really forget that, but no, this marks no significant state change in the relationship between the square-jawed master of no lips and the spherically-headed master of blank stares. well, then, can we say that at least this is indicative of the reason that jhonny peralta can be considered a net asset? sure, this we can say. we could ask him to be more consistent, but we could also ask for maple syrup to come out of the pipes of the guest bathroom. quantum mechanics tells us these things are possible, yet somehow, i am not holding my breath in anticipation of their eminent arrival. he seems to be playing better at third than i thought he would, although, admittedly, i thought that he would have been struck in the face by multiple line drives by this point in the season, so this is not an entirely-meaningful measuring stick. he's playing like a third baseman and hitting like a third baseman, and i'll take that for now. wedge really does need to invest in some lips, though. 6) speaking of struck by multiple line drives ... choo had a pair of hits last night, including a homer off a left-handed relief pitcher, matt thornton. this is good: choo is actually hitting lefties at a .244/.371/.397 clip, which is a big improvement over the perceived past. (actually, from 2006-2008, choo hit .276/.343/.408 against lefties: i'm not sure where he got this "platoon guy" tag, but it doesn't appear to have come from, y'know, anything like data.) anyway, that's good. except that he needed that homer to lift his june slg all the way to ... .418. with all the streakiness and collapsing and injuries and everything else, to this point, choo has been the one rock of steadiness. he hit .274/.409/.479 in april. he hit .311/.414/.472 in may. the average is different, but the obp and slg are virtually identical. in june, he is hitting .296, right in the middle of april and may, and his june obp of .395 is within sight of the low-.400s he was putting up before. in april, shoo had 9 extra-base hits: 6 doubles and 3 homers. in may, 8 xbh: 3 doubles, a triple, and 4 homers. in june, only 6 (3 doubles, 3 homers). these are not huge numbers, and you turn a couple singles into doubles and you wonder what my point is. but the trend is going the wrong way: hopefully, this is just a slow month for choo's power (you want small-sample discouragement, check out victor martinez' month-by-month batting averages). 8) welcome to the club, you'll fit right in! he hit the first hitter in the head. in all seriousness, all due wishes for a speedy and full recovery for alexei ramirez. very bad. he hit jermaine dye with a pitch that would have hit the shorter ramirez in the head again. very, he walked jim thome, but this is merely bad. a lot of people have walked jim thome. and then, on the inning-ending double play ball to first, perez ... did not cover first base. would this definitely have been a double play? i don't know about definitely. but it definitely was not a double play without perez covering the bag, and a run scored. and then he simply went insane, giving up a double to getz, a wild pitch, and a run-scoring single. and here's the kicker: had he covered first base and we had turned the double play ... we would have won the damn game 3-2! (okay, you can't technically say that: jenks may have come out, or dotel might have pitched more carefully, or what have you, but coming back from 2-0 is certainly a lit different from having to come back from 6-0.)

T	tharperobbins reaches new plateau in environmental responsibility : published at carolinanewswire.com - stay on top of the day's business & technology news
C	 tharperobbins reaches new plateau in environmental responsibility statesville, n.c. - the tharperobbins company, inc. has another environmental accomplishment to add to its already impressive roster: the attleboro, mass. facility is no longer required to operate under a restricted emissions status. due to its low emissions rate of less than one ton per year, the department of environmental protection (dep) has determined that it's no longer necessary. "this new classification puts the attleboro facility on a more responsible and eco-friendly level with the dep," says joseph viveiros, vice president of manufacturing for the tharperobbins company, a global leader in the managed employee reward and recognition industry. "among manufacturers, it is a coveted position due to the high standards of the organization." in annual inspections by the dep since 2005, tharperobbins has controlled up to 99 percent of all emissions including volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants and particulates. in addition, because of the minimal emissions, the new status enables tharperobbins to operate six paint spray booths for manufacturing emblems, jewelry and insignia. the company has a number of additional environmentally-friendly practices already in place including: water recycling system - in order to ensure a 98.3 percent reduction in water usage, tharperobbins created a state-of-the-art, closed-loop process that reduces annual water usage from 500,000 gallons a week to just 650 gallons a week. toxic use reduction - with a goal of reducing the chemical content in the company's wastewater by 98 percent, the company's closed loop process is designed to prevent chemicals from returning to the environment. biodegradable packaging - to help save our landfills, most packing peanuts are soy- or corn-based and will dissolve. a majority of the trays used in packaging are made of biodegradable foam instead of traditional plastic. recycling - recycling all paper in the tharperobbins' facilities produces an average of 12 to 20 tons a year. according to the national recycling coalition, each ton (2,000 pounds) of this recycled paper can save 17 trees, 380 gallons of oil, three cubic yards of landfill space, 4,000 kilowatts of energy, and 7,000 gallons of water. collection bins are placed in all facilities to recycle waste paper, cans and bottles. all new packing material is 100 percent recycled and all incoming packing materials are reused. lighting - light bulbs in all facilities are non-mercury bearing and recyclable. the company has a '100% lights off policy' throughout all facilities to conserve energy when rooms are not in use. "as an industry leader, tharperobbins is committed to pursuing sound environmental practices," says viveiros. "with many of these initiatives already in place, we are constantly seeking new ways to further minimize our industrial footprint." the privately-held tharperobbins was created through the february 2007 merger of the robbins company, founded in 1892, and the tharpe company inc., founded in 1981. customized programs include products ranging from personalized jewelry to fine art, electronics, sports equipment and outdoor merchandise. the company also offers rewards through local and national services, entertainment and recreation.

T	swot analysis
C	 a scan of the internal and external environment is an important part of the strategic planning process. environmental factors internal to the firm usually can be classified as strengths (s) or weaknesses (w), and those external to the firm can be classified as opportunities (o) or threats (t). such an analysis of the strategic environment is referred to as a swot analysis. the swot analysis provides information that is helpful in matching the firm's resources and capabilities to the competitive environment in which it operates. as such, it is instrumental in strategy formulation and selection. the following diagram shows how a swot analysis fits into an environmental scan: swot analysis framework environmental scan / \ internal analysis external analysis / \ / \ strengths weaknesses opportunities threats | swot matrix the above is a schema of how swot works. you start at the top level and go down to details. when this is filled with content, it gets the shape of a matrix, such as the example below: swot analysis provides a framework for visioning by helping the planners to identify and prioritize the organization's goals and to further identify the strategies of achieving them. assessing the internal environment internal scan or assessment of the internal environment of the organization involves identification of its strengths and weaknesses i.e., those aspects that help or hinder accomplishment of the organization's mission and fulfillment of its mandate with respect to the following four ps : 1. p eople (human resources) 2. p roperties (buildings, equipments and other facilities) 3. p rocesses (such as student placement services, m.i.s etc.) 4. p roducts (students, publications etc.) assessing the external environment external scan refers to exploring the environment outside the organisation in order to identify the opportunities and threats it faces. this involves considering the following: events, trends and forces in the s ocial, t echnological, e conomical, e nvironmental and p olitical areas ( steep ). identifying the shifts in the needs of customers and potential clients and identification of competitors and collaborators. while assessing the external environment the planners have to also consider the forces and trends in terms of the institute's c ustomers, c lients, c ompetitors and c ollaborators (cccc). customers - the employers who hire the graduates of the institute are in fact the customers of the institute. what do these employers need in terms of skills, knowledge and attitudes in potential employees and current employees? clients - the full-time students are clients of the institute, but there is a much larger potential market of clients for part-time, evening and weekend courses - adults seeking job-related and personal development skills and knowledge. what does this market have to offer in terms of opportunities? competitors - public and private institutions which do or can potentially draw away the students (clients) and employers (customers) who hire graduates of the institute. are there some opportunities for sharing and helping even more people, or do these institutions threaten to restrict or even close down the polytechnic? collaborators - all of the partners and supporters of the institute, such as the chamber of commerce and industry, societies and associations of engineers and business owners, apex advisory councils and committees, other educational institutions and particular government and funding agencies. tool for swot analysis conduct focus group meeting invite employees to meet for about an hour and "focus" them on the four ps or steep to give their perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses or opportunities and threats. simple rules for successful swot analysis. be realistic about the strengths and weaknesses of your organization when conducting swot analysis. swot analysis should distinguish between where your organization is today, and where it could be in the future. swot should always be specific. avoid grey areas. always apply swot in relation to your competition i.e. better than or worse than your competition. keep your swot short and simple. avoid complexity and over analysis. swot is subjective. once key issues have been identified with your swot analysis, they feed into marketing objectives. swot can be used in conjunction with other tools for audit and analysis, such as pest analysis and porter's five-forces analysis . so swot is a very popular tool with marketing students because it is quick and easy to learn. during the swot exercise, list factors in the relevant boxes. it's that simple. swot analysis limitations while useful for reducing a large quantity of situational factors into a more manageable profile, the swot framework has a tendency to oversimplify the situation by classifying the firm's environmental factors into categories in which they may not always fit. the classification of some factors as strengths or weaknesses, or as opportunities or threats is somewhat arbitrary. for example, a particular company culture can be either a strength or a weakness. a technological change can be a either a threat or an opportunity. perhaps what is more important than the superficial classification of these factors is the firm's awareness of them and its development of a strategic plan to use them to its advantage.

T	tennis world: tennis,safina sets up venus semi-final
C	 safina sets up venus semi-final wimbledon date: 22 june - 5 july fiery safina fights back to reach semi-finals world number one dinara safina fought back to beat unseeded 19-year-old german sabine lisicki and reach the semi-finals at wimbledon. the russian won 6-7 (5-7) 6-4 6-1 in soaring temperatures on centre court. she will next face defending champion venus williams, who thrashed agnieszka radwanska 6-1 6-2 despite some heavy strapping on her knee. serena williams overpowered victoria azarenka and will face elena dementieva in the other semi-final on friday. dementieva, the fourth seed, power through with a 6-2 6-2 thrashing of italian francesca schiavone. safina went into the first semi-final on centre court as the favourite against lisicki, but the russian had never previously been past the third round and has been no great fan of grass in the past. mental toughness was key - safina lisicki, on other hand, was far deeper into uncharted territory having only once before made the third round at a grand slam. however, the german was on a high after beating ninth seed caroline wozniacki in the previous round and she broke serve first in the semi-final when safina double-faulted in game three. lisicki was serving beautifully as she moved 5-3 clear, saving a couple of break points in game four, but the nerves took hold and she was pegged back to a tie-break. again it was the german who took the initiative but she looked in trouble when two set points went begging, until safina handed over a woeful double-fault on the third. the frustrated russian was warned for racquet abuse early in the second set but she regained her composure to break for 4-3 and served out, saving a break-back point in the process. a tense final set looked to be on the cards but safina dominated, breaking twice in a row and holding her nerve during a lengthy medical time-out as lisicki received treatment on her calf. 606: debate can safina beat venus? the 23-year-old broke once again for a victory that keeps her on track to end he grand slam drought, but she will need to improve drastically on the 15 double faults she gave up. "i think i was santa claus serving so many double faults," said safina. "on the practice court i don't serve a single one. "the serve is there, i just have to put the brain there. i know what i have to do, i'm just not doing it. "i was hanging in there. i was tough mentally, i think that was the key." lisicki said: "i just went out there to fight. i gave it all i had, but she was physically fitter than me." venus williams wasted little time in seeing off the 11th seed radwanska. venus dreaming of all-williams final the american, 29, had too much power and athleticism as she won in 68 minutes on court one. the champion clambered all over the radwanska serve from the start and, despite some valiant scrambling from the pole, williams converted her fourth break point to go 2-0 clear. within 18 minutes the american was 5-0 up and when radwanska, 20, did get on the board it only provided temporary relief, and the chance for the crowd to finally get involved, before williams wrapped up the set in 28 minutes with an ace. radwanska looked to be coping better with the pace at the start of the second but it still came as a shock when she got to 0-40 in game two and converted her first chance to break. it was hardly a crisis for williams, however, and she broke twice in succession before firing a magnificent cross-court backhand winner to get to 5-2, and sealed victory soon after with a huge forehand into the corner. "she plays the ball so low and so fast, i'm happy to get through," williams told bbc sport. do i feel invincible? i'd like to say yes, but i really do work at it venus williams "i'm in the semi-finals of wimbledon, it's where i want to be and i'm looking to go further." asked about a possible final against her sister, she added: "that would be fantastic, it's what serena and i want, but we still have to play well and bring our best tennis to the the court." the sisters, the only two grand slam winners left in the women's field, have dominated wimbledon in recent years, with venus winning five singles titles and serena two. "do i feel invincible? i'd like to say yes, but i really do work at it. to close these matches out takes a lot of work," said venus. "we are definitely the front-runners in tennis as far as being some of the best players out there. "i just think that the style of game that serena and i play, that particular style, we play better than the other women." radwanska admitted that in hot, fast conditions, it was almost impossible to defeat venus. "she was serving and hitting the ball so strongly. her game is so powerful, it was very hard to do anything on the court," she said. "it's so hard to break her when she's serving at 120mph. venus and serena are so different to other opponents."

T	roguejourno: eye on the ball
C	 my journalistic wanderings tuesday took me to the hitter's choice batting cages in an industrial park in redlands, a stone's throw away from loma linda. i was there on business, but the place intrigued me in a general kind of way. there were no batting cages when i played ball in the 1960s and early 70s, so hitter's choice was a revelation. it's a sweltering, sweat shop of a place where mostly teen-age boys and girls take their whacks at very fast pitches hurled or shot from machines at an impossibly close range. some kids are there on their own and some have private instructors or well-meaning dads monitoring their progress. i watched a 14-year-old girl named alexi who will be a freshman in the fall at redlands east valley high. she hit neon yellow softballs fed into a machine by her father, rod. the balls rocketed out of the machine at a brisk pace from 30 feet and she hit every one of them. her eye-hand coordination was extraordinary. then i watched a former pro baseball player named dan davidsmeier tutor a yucaipa high senior named matt hardison. hardison last season backed up third baseman matt davidson, who just signed a $900,000 bonus with the arizona diamondbacks. davidsmeier also taught davidson the finer points of striking a ball. between almost every swing, the well-chiseled davidsmeier imparted bits of wisdom to his young charge. hardison, who went 3-for-10 at the plate in 2009 in his limited chances behind davidson, told me his goal is to make the major leagues. who am i to doubt him? there was also an entire travel ball team there, inland empire elite. one by one, the gold-shirted young teens stepped to the fore, taking their whacks against the rapid offerings of the iron machine. i suppose there is an element of fun in all of this, though much of it looked like very hard work. maybe the real joy is performing at peak level in games. or, better yet, cashing a $900,000 check from a big-league club. to comment, write your comment and hit post. then when given an option, choose name/url, but leave url blank. you may also post anonymously.

T	maine credit union league: press releases
C	 "credit unions' credit cards far more favorable," harvard study concludes two harvard university doctoral students recently released findings of a study on credit cards. their findings: "credit unions are less likely to charge the fees and penalties that the new act hopes to eliminate-and when they do, they charge less than other issuers." these findings reaffirm the findings of a similar study done by a noted maine economist last year, which found that consumers in maine saved nearly $5 million a year in interest rates and fees by having a credit card through a credit union. the harvard study, conducted by ryan bubb and alex kaufman, found that credit unions largely conform to the new rules already, while profitably maintaining the basic features that users know and love. new york times, bubb and kaufman wrote: "the credit card act is under fire for limiting a number of fees commonly used in credit card contracts, like the charge for going over the credit limit and the increased interest rate that applies once a borrower has missed a payment. these changes might look like a boon for the average card user, but industry advocates claim that fees on delinquent borrowers subsidize the perks for those who pay on time. take away the lucrative fees, the argument goes, and credit card issuers will be forced to ax free plane rides, slash generous credit limits and impose hefty annual dues for all. some in the industry even say that profitability would require issuers to charge interest from the moment of purchase, thus eliminating the grace period of interest-free lending that borrowers have long enjoyed. these fears are largely unfounded. we have performed a study that compared credit cards issued by investor-owned banks to those issued by member-owned credit unions. we found that credit unions are less likely to charge the fees and penalties that the new act hopes to eliminate-and when they do, they charge less than other issuers." additionally, the study found while virtually all banks and other for-profit issuers increase the interest rate if the borrower fails to make a minimum payment on time, most credit unions do not. similarly, credit union fees for exceeding the credit limit are on average just half those of other issuers. but contrary to industry assertions, more responsible card users don't pay the price. credit union cards actually offer lower annual fees and longer grace periods than regular cards. bubb and kaufman further found that the lending model used by credit unions was feasible for banks and other issuers. "banks and credit unions compete for customers in the same market. the primary distinguishing characteristic of credit unions is that they answer to a different group of owners: profits that are not reinvested are paid to the union?s shareholder-customers as a dividend, much as investor-owned banks reinvest or pay dividends to their shareholder-investors." john murphy, president of the maine credit union league, called the harvard study's findings "more evidence of the value and philosophy of credit unions. it is gratifying to see that the study is calling for policies and procedures at other institutions to follow the example of credit unions. the bottom line is that maine credit unions are about always putting the best interests of consumers first. 600,000 maine consumers who use a credit union are already enjoying these benefits and we are seeing more and more maine people flocking to credit unions because of what credit union membership offers. maine credit unions have always been a great deal and, in today's economic environment, that is even more true."

T	ford could do equity deal within a year: jp morgan
C	 ford could do equity deal within a year: jp morgan more story tools presented by detroit -- ford motor co management is focused on reducing company debt, increasing the likelihood of an equity or equity-linked raising of capital within six months to a year, a j.p. morgan analyst said friday. ford appears "intensely focused" on addressing a us$10.5-billion revolving credit that matures in december 2011 and would not be expected to wait to the last minute, himanshu patel said in a note to clients that referenced a visit with ford management. "we see an equity raise within the next six to 12 months," the note said. ford declined to comment on the report. addressing the revolver is a positive for ford's long-term survival odds, but raises the odds of material equity dilution of about 20 percent sooner rather than later, j.p. morgan said. j.p. morgan also expects a "meaningful" second-quarter earnings beat for ford due to improved pricing in north america and europe and sequential production improvement in both regions. credit suisse also believes ford could report a significant upside surprise in the second quarter. j.p. morgan believes ford will be able to roll at least part of the revolver into a new secured facility and is focused on overall debt, not a single maturity, raising the odds of an equity or equity-linked raise of capital. ford "seems fully cognizant of" its relatively riskier capital structure compared with the new general motors co, it said. gm emerged from bankruptcy with significantly less debt. "as such, we think ford has its eyes on delevering, not just terming out maturities,"j.p. morgan said. ford could consider initially raising longer-term debt financing, which with likely better-than-expected second-quarter and third-quarter earnings, could allow shares to rally and permit tapping equity markets to repay debt, it said. ford could address the revolver through us$3-billion of refinanced secured debt, us$2-billion of excess energy department funds, us$2-billion of free cash flow in 2011 and us$3.5-billion of capital through an equity or equity-linked raise, j.p. morgan said. jp morgan recommends qantas skynews, new zealand - wednesday, july 29, 2009 ninemsn.com.au - tuesday, july 28, 2009 jpmorgan solar picks and pans (ener, eslr, fslr, asti, spwra) 24/7 wall st. - thursday, july 2, 2009 conde nast portfolio - thursday, june 4, 2009 conde nast portfolio - wednesday, november 19, 2008 phased retirement mercer actuary hamilton on phased retirement bear market rally or bull market? bear market rally or bull market? it doesn't matter says templeton growth's lisa myers why precious metals are best hedge nick barisheff on why precious metals are best hedge coming double-digit inflation spreading investments the successful investor's pat mckeough on spreading investments across five sectors monique tremblay part 2 monique tremblay on changes to cpp/qpp and impact on early retirement. monique tremblay part 1 generating income in retirement: desjardin's monique tremblay on annuities and gmwbs atkinson on leveraged etfs betapro management inc. president howard atkinson sets the record straight on leveraged etfs allison graham allison graham, entrepreneur and author, talks to fp executive's john turley-ewart about the dos and don'ts of networking. don reed part 2 don't lose twice, seize the stock opportunity now: reed, president franklin templeton. don reed part 1 march was the bottom, says franklin templeton's reed. points and rewards the feds now say the points you earn charging items on your personal credit card on behalf of your company are no longer taxable. who knew they were actually taxable in the first place? tom hamza part 2 investored's hamza on raising financial literacy for the young. tom hanza part 1 tom hamza on how investored.ca helps investors. tax freedom day 2009 tax freedom day fell on june 6 this year. that's the day when the average canadian family stops paying taxes to all levels of government and starts working for themselves. the day falls three days earlier than it did in 2008. sandy cardy part 2 tax-loss selling not just a year-end activity, mackenzie's cardy says. sandy cardy part 1 mackenzie senior vp sandy cardy on tax free savings accounts

T	local news | hasselbeck forming bond with newest target | seattle times newspaper
C	share hasselbeck forming bond with newest target ever since matt hasselbeck has been a quarterback for the seattle seahawks he always had one security blanket to turn to when the team needed a big play. renton, wash. - ever since matt hasselbeck has been a quarterback for the seattle seahawks he always had one security blanket to turn to when the team needed a big play. throw the ball to number 84. for the past eight seasons, that was bobby engram. engram is now gone and in his place is another number 84 - tj houshmandzadeh. but that connection between hasselbeck and number 84 is still there. saturday against the kansas city chiefs, hasselbeck bobbled a snap from center and snagged it out of the air. houshmandzadeh read the play and stopped dead in his tracks at the line of scrimmage instead of releasing into the secondary. hasselbeck then threw a chest pass with two hands to houshmandzadeh that went for 17 yards and a first down. "the ball just popped right out like a football follies kind of video and there was t.j.," hasselbeck said after the game. "i kind of gave him a little chest pass and he did the rest." houshmandzadeh knew hasselbeck's only options were to try and run it himself and take a hit or attempt to get the ball to him to try and make a positive play out of it. "i saw at the snap that he kind of last control of the ball," houshmandzadeh said. "i was supposed to go block and i didn't go block because i saw that he had lost the ball and he tossed it to me and then you just kind of go from there and improvise a little bit." seahawks head coach jim mora was thrilled with hasselbeck's decision. "i was thinking don't run," mora said of hasselbeck. "that's fine, just don't run." "that's a heads up play by matt. a broken play that he turns into a first down. to me, it just shows he's an aware player. he's always looking to make something happen." that kind of play is usually reserved for a quarterback and receiver that have played together for years - the kind of play hasselbeck and engram used to make to extend drives. houshmandzadeh has only been with seattle since march, but the chemistry between the two is developing quickly. "my observation is that it's certainly growing," head coach jim mora said of the trust between the two. "watching it, it looks like he feels pretty good about throwing the ball to him. especially when he throws the chest pass to him. it seems like they're doing well." engram and hasselbeck developed their relationship over many years of working together. hasselbeck's ability to read defenses and check off into better plays for the offense. engram's uncanny knack to know where to sit down in a zone coverage. hasselbeck has only had one offseason to work with his new weapon. but through three preseason games, the duo has combined for 106 yards on 11 receptions and two touchdowns. "you can see why he's caught so many balls," mora said. "he's physical. he runs tremendous routes. he's got glue hands. he can block. he's a team player. he's a physical presence and he was a very good acquisition for this football team." the connection between houshmandzadeh and hasselbeck may not be as strong as the one he had with his former number 84, but the relationship is off to a good start. "obviously it's going to get better as the weeks progress and as we progress in the season," houshmandzadeh said. "i wouldn't say we're there yet. we're trying to get there and it's going to take time." number of women farmers growing in washington state and nationally

T	arsenal and friends: 3 question marks to arsenal quest for glory
C	 as arsenal is brought down to earth by our physical and defensive fragilities, the same critics who a week ago was declaring arsenal a winning team have changed their voices to a nearly team. which definition fit yours? is the current team a winning team or a nearly team? what factors or personnel can change the course of this team at this moment of the league run? in my mind, barring any injuries or new signings (if ever), the three most volatile players in this current team would be arshavin, diaby and almunia or ada collectively. while fabregas, rvp and gallas can be depended on week-in and week-out to play at the highest level, ada's performances can fluctuate from brilliant to despairing. depending on how ada plays, they can influence the outcome of the trophy cabinets in the emirates stadium. almunia answered his critics last season with a solid season that gave him confidence to command the posts. it even led to suggestions that he could be the answer to england's goalkeeping problems as he is eligible to play for england this season. his run of eight clean sheets in his first 11 appearance was cemented with a splendid stop from robbie keane's spot kick to allow him to claim number one position in the fan's heart. however, he began this season in quite horrible style. he was out-jumped by kaboul in the portsmouth match to a high floating ball that any decent goalkeeper could have caught. as the game was held precariously at 2-1 after the goal, almunia should have thanked the guys for sewing up the match for him. he was again caught out with his awareness and judgment when he came rushing out to give rooney a chance to dive even though the manchester united striker was going nowhere with the ball. many fans wondered what he was doing rushing out like a mad dog. i think almunia was still thinking about that when he failed to come out and claim the high cross which was eventually headed in by a totally confused diaby for an exquisite own goal. it is a simple communication process of shouting, "my ball!" and coming out for it. will almunia rise to his levels of last season or will he sink to the depths of being sold? will fabianski or mannone step up and give almunia a reminder that the number 1 shirt needs to be earn on merit and not age? almunia himself should know consistent performances from an experienced keeper are the key to trophies. what about diaby? this lad can make you cry in pain or make you scream for joy. as shown in the portsmouth game, he can single handedly destroyed a team with his silky skills and powerful runs. however, his lack of concentration is also evident when he inexplicitly flicked the ball home with his head for united under no pressure at all. much like the sound of music song of "what do you do with a girl like maria….?", i often scratch my head and wonder, "what do you do with a player like diaby?" this is a player who was deemed to be the next patrick vieira and who captained france under-19s to success in the 2005 european championship. at 23 years old, he is the most appropriate player to fit into the mould of the central midfielder to complement fabregas vision. however, his inconsistency and injury-plagued career has left many gunners pulling their hair out in frustration when one looks at the output of this raw diamond. he was purring at the start of the season until that own goal marred an otherwise perfect start to the season. he actually had a chance to redeem himself straight away after his own goal with a brillant shimmy that left two united defenders gasping at air. however, when one on one with ben foster, diaby shot wide and missed out on a chance for hero-ship. will the young frenchman recovered from this setback or will the own goal haunt him for the rest of the season? the way he reacts will play a great part in determining the success of the arsenal team on the pitch. the greatest enigma will be on the shoulders of a certain russian named andrey arshavin. captain of the russian side and at the age of 28, his experience in winning leagues and cups put him in a great position to help this team to greatness. his four goal exploit against liverpool at anfield also made him an instant cult hero among the arsenal supporters. arshavin is truly a world class player capable of winning games on his own. so what is wrong with arshavin? in the past few games, he did not looked happy. even when he scored his thunderbolt against united, his happiness seemed muted with a definitive stare at the bench instead of true happiness which was seen at anfield last season. the murmurs on the tax structure by arshavin's agent and also the claims that arshavin is only a 20 minute player did not add to a happy background at all. will arshavin become the destabilizing factor similar to the then-captain of gallas? or will he rise to the occasion like the ex-captain gallas? which player will we see? i sure hope he will match the exploits of gallas this season and contribute more goals with his russian torpedoes. with the spine of the arsenal team in place, these 3 players will play a crucial or cursory part to assist the spine in search of titles. will they destroy the team with their performances or will they rise to the challenge of the game? for the sake of gooners around the world, i hope it's the latter that will materialize.

T	loyalties undivided for uw ad | the news tribune - sports | seattle-tacoma news, weather, sports, jobs, homes and cars | south puget sound's destination
C	 any exercise in shrewd administration - whether it be overseeing 650 student-athletes at the university of washington or a few family members in his household - should be right in scott woodward's wheelhouse. and this week will be a special test for woodward's judgment. the huskies' 45-year-old athletic director is an alumnus of louisiana state, which will send its football team to seattle to take on the huskies on saturday night in the season opener for both. woodward worked at lsu (2000-04), rising to director of external affairs for the university chancellor, before joining that chancellor - fife native mark emmert - at uw when emmert became university president. the debut of woodward's biggest uw hire - huskies football coach steve sarkisian, set to make roughly $1.8 million this season - could be spoiled by his alma mater. woodward will have to manage his feelings this week, but that won't happen at some lsu alumni gathering, or when he hooks up with old colleagues from the south. no, he will be tested when setting ground rules for his son, michael evans, who is a junior at lsu and an avid fan of tigers football. evans, who arrives in seattle on friday, has woodward's permission to wear all the lsu apparel he wants around the house. the catch? "he's bringing a friend, and they can wear it in my house," woodward said. "but he's camping out at the gorge on friday for the dave matthews band, so we won't see too much of that lsu gear around." woodward grew up in baton rouge - lsu's home. he was a peanut vendor at tiger stadium as a youth. he attended catholic high school, which he says sends "90 percent" of its college-bound students to lsu. and he attended so many home football games as a college student, he can't remember all of them. "it's always been a special place to me," woodward said. ask him if he's felt any divided loyalty this week - frankly, he hasn't. he's been away from lsu since 2004 - long enough for some of the shine to dim. "i really don't know anyone on the direct football staff, as far as assistant coaches. i've met (d.j.) mccarthy (lsu receivers coach and former uw player). i've met (coach) les (miles) a couple times. other than that, i don't know anyone," woodward said. "i do know all the trainers. i know the strength staff. i know the administrators, and they're all coming. i know the senior administrators in the athletic department, and they're all good friends of mine, and i look forward to seeing them." woodward said he and emmert will meet with a few lsu fans this week. but that won't distract him from his chief responsibility. "my focus is on the university of washington and getting us better," said woodward, who is in charge of the department's $60 million budget. "we've got some things to do there - donors to see and obligations to do - and i'll squeeze (my lsu friends) in when i can." extra points the huskies published their two-deep depth chart monday, and it revealed a major reshuffling of the offensive line. right tackle drew schaefer is out as a starter, and cody habben will move there from left tackle. ben ossai , who had moved inside to left guard, will return to left tackle for a fourth season. and the surprise addition? it's junior gregory christine , a former walk-on, who inherits left guard. christine has played in one game, last year in mop-up duty against california. "we really tried to just go back and evaluate all of fall camp, and not get stuck on (who was on the no. 1 and 2 offenses) and that's why there was lots of shake-up throughout fall camp. we just wanted to put a lot of different scenarios out there," sarkisian said. "greg christine has had a tremendous fall camp, and he deserves the opportunity to start at left guard." … freshman desmond trufant, a wilson high product whose first practice was aug. 20, is listed as cornerback co-starter with vonzell mcdowell jr. - until justin glenn (knee) gets healthy. … a week ago, three true freshmen were ruled ineligible on a clerical matter by the ncaa. two have been cleared, but linebacker tim tucker 's case remains in limbo. … at night practice, defensive tackle cameron elisara (shoulder) wore the red jersey (no hitting), and did nothing with the no. 1 defense. he was replaced by de'shone matthews . … tight end kavario middleton (hamstring) drilled lightly with the first-unit offense, but had no contact. … uw scout-team players wore the numbers of the lsu starters they were represented. … sarkisian said the huskies are planning schedules for 2017 and 2018. todd milles: 253-597-8442 todd.milles@thenewstribune.com blogs.thenewstribune.com/uwsports huskies' opponent this week 7:30 p.m. saturday, husky stadium, espn, 950-am coach: les miles (42-11), fifth season. he has a 70-32 overall record in eight seasons. last season: 8-5, 3-5 in the southeastern conference. beat georgia tech, 38-3, in the chick-fil-a bowl. against the huskies: lsu leads, 1-0, winning 40-14 in 1983. washington connections: tigers receivers coach d.j. mccarthy, from boca raton, fla., played from 1991 to 1993 with the huskies as a reserve receiver. … offensive coordinator gary crowton is 2-0 against the huskies as the ex-offensive coordinator at oregon (2005-06). scouting report: to give an idea of the drastic directions these two programs have gone recently, consider the number of top-25 wins each team has had since 2005: lsu has 17; the huskies' lone victory was over no. 22 boise state in 2007. yet last season wasn't the kindest to the tigers, who posted their first sec losing record under miles. and while jarrett lee's habit of throwing interceptions cost lsu a win or two - and ultimately cost him his job - the biggest culprit was the defense, which gave up big plays in the secondary and surrendered 30 or more points five times. longtime tennessee defensive coordinator john chavis was hired to fix it. did you know: true freshman russell shepard, the team's backup quarterback, was rated the no. 1 athlete in the 2009 recruiting class by espn and could see time at receiver as well. jarrett lee26914353.21,8731416 jordan jefferson733649.341941 charles scott2171,1745.418 keiland williams834175.02 richard murphy441864.20 jordan jefferson491342.71 receivingrecyardsavgtd brandon lafell6392914.78 richard dickson3132410.55 terrence toliver2225711.71 puntingpuntsavgblk josh jasper443.00 josh jasper2233 2009 schedule saturday at washington sept. 12 vanderbilt sept. 19 ul-lafayette sept. 26 at mississippi state oct. 3 at georgia oct. 10 florida oct. 24 auburn oct. 31 tulane nov. 7 at alabama nov. 14 louisiana tech nov. 21 at mississippi nov. 28 arkansas join the discussion we welcome comments. please keep them civil, short and to the point. all caps, spam, obscene, profane, abusive and off topic comments will be deleted. repeat offenders will be blocked. thanks for taking part - and abiding by these simple rules. mcgrath: mcgrath: on any other day, o'meara walks away with a win bumpus waived; hawks now down to 75 players goodbye to a baseball man, lee pelekoudas hey, was that lsu's lafell running a seam route? view every news page every day with the digital edition of the news tribune.

T	ak-2009.09.01.1.0 release notes - fishworks - wikis.sun.com
C	2009.q3.1.0 this minor release contains a number of bug fixes for the 2009.q3 release. this update is recommended for all users, particularly those using iscsi (especially with isns), shadow migration, clustering, infiniband, and raidz. issues addressed the following crs have been fixed in this release: could not discover iscsi luns on solaris client, via ib link 6876884 comstar: target portal group not created after factory reset followed by intial configuration comstar iscsi: remove old target portal groups before adding new ones cli: updating an ipmp interface often blows away configured standbys config restore core dumps in nas_iscsit_rm_import cio should fail transmit when fin is received shadow migration never starts if '.zfs' is visible alert: an attempt to import the resource 'ak:/shadow/pool-0' has failed shadow migration: enotsup files should be ignored shadow migration: panic while accessing snapshot shadow migration: certain fids can result in incorrect hard link table shadow migration: memory leak in vfs_shadow_add_link() raid-z performance changes out of sync with on 6875917 smbd crashes when running netview on ad domain member isns client should handle portal list changes iscsit isns client does not re-register properly after reboot panic occurs when the iscsi target is registered to an isns server comstar: isns deregistration not sent during graceful poweroff/reboot iscsi target should support a non-esi option for keeping up to date with isns server failed assertion on iscsi_target_list/global_target_list inconsistency network datalink modifications do not rename routes the configuration/network view permits a wide variety of networking configuration changes on the sun storage system. one such change is taking an existing network interface and associating it with a different network datalink, effectively moving the interface's ip addresses to a different physical link (or links, in the case of an aggregation). in this scenario, the network routes associated with the original interface are automatically deleted, and must be re-added by the administrator to the new interface. in some situations this may imply loss of a path to particular hosts until those routes are restored. considerations when reconfiguring the active administrative network interface the configuration/network view permits a wide variety of networking configuration changes on the sun storage system. one such change is modifying or deleting the active administrative interface over which the administrator is connected to the web browser or command-line interface itself, which may also be providing the default route for the system. the appliance software attempts to detect such modifications and warn the administrator first. if such a reconfiguration is confirmed or not detected in advance, the administrator will lose contact with the appliance during the network reconfiguration. the network reconfiguration will complete, but if contact cannot be restored with the appliance (by reloading the web address or reconnecting using ssh) due to an error in the configuration applied by the administrator or the loss of the default route, the administrator should log in using the service processor console and correct the configuration using the command-line. j4400 emits audible alarm when a drive is hot-unplugged in the current version of j4400 array firmware, used in the disk enclosures for the sun storage 7410, the j4400 emits an audible alarm when a disk drive is hot-unplugged. the alarm warns the operator that a drive has been removed, and the alarm is silenced when the drive is replaced, either by the original drive or by a new replacement. in some operator scenarios, it may be preferable to not emit such an alarm, particularly if a spare drive is not immediately available. the operator can manually silence the alarm by depressing a button on the j4400 front panel. future versions of the j4400 firmware and appliance software will disable this behavior and/or permit it to be configured by the administrator. changing active directory domains requires a cifs service restart when reconfiguring the active directory service to participate in a different domain, restart the cifs service before attempting to reconfigure the active directory service. appliance doesn't boot after removing first system disk in a 7210 system, removing the first system disk will make the system unbootable, despite the presence of a second mirrored disk. to workaround this issue, break into the bios boot menu, under 'hdd boot order', modify the list so the first item is "[scsi:#0300 id00 lu]". cifs service fails with large network configs under heavy load in large configurations, the first sim card (sim 0) can fail. the symptoms are a blue led on the card itself and an audible alarm, with possible alerts in the ui regarding paths and/or power supplies being removed from the chassis. i/o will continue down other available paths, and there no impact to availability, though performance may suffer. re-seating the sim card (removing it and inserting it) should fix the problem. if this problem persists, please contact sun support. automatic snapshot deletion interferes with replication if an automatic snapshot is deleted during replication of the same project, it's possible for the replication to fail. the safest workaround is to disable automatic snapshots if a project is being replicated. alternatively, picking a schedule that is guaranteed to not interfere with ongoing replication may work, but is dependent on each incremental replication stream being sent in a well-defined period of time. microsoft internet explorer 8 is not supported ndmp backups of appliance data includes share metadata, including projects, shares, and share properties (see the documentation for details). however, user quotas (new to the 2009.q3 release) are currently not backed up with ndmp. this configuration will have to be manually restored. ndmp does not backup nested filesystems ndmp does not backup nested filesystems (new to 2009.q3). when creating filesystems mounted within other filesystems, be sure to specify each mountpoint separately in the ndmp dma backup configuration. infiniband performance impacted by disabling lso lso is disabled in 2009.q3 in order to address certain data integrity issues. this has a noticeable adverse effect on ipoib performance. lso will be reenabled in a minor update once the integrity issues have been resolved. data integrity and connectivity issues with nfs/rdma the nfs/rdma support in 2009.q3 is a preview for early adopters and should not be used on production systems. there are currently no supported clients. linux clients still under development have experienced data validation errors and loss of access to nfs/rdma shares on the appliance. iscsi target and initiator groups must be synchronized between replication peers the 2009.q3 release introduces target groups and initiator groups on which individual iscsi luns are exported. when replicating projects containing iscsi luns using the built-in remote replication feature, ensure that the target groups and initiator groups used by luns within the project also exist on the replication target. it's only required that groups exist with the same name, not that they define the same configuration. failure to ensure this can result in failure to clone and network interfaces may fail to come up in large jumbogram configurations in systems with large numbers of network interfaces using jumbo frames, some network interfaces may fail to come up due to hardware resource limitations. such network interfaces will be unavailable, but will not be shown as faulted in the bui or cli. if this occurs, turn off jumbo frames on some of the network interfaces. ipoib datalinks become misconfigured live cable and/or subnet manager partition re-configuration may result in mis-configured ipoib network devices, datalinks or interfaces. if this happens, delete the affected ipoib interfaces and partition datalinks on the affected controller. to recover the underlying ipoib device, make sure that all ib cables are properly configured and the subnet manager is up and running with a valid partition table. next, reboot the controller with the mis-configured ipoib device. default route becomes inactive after configuration restore after performing a configuration restore, the default route may become inactive. it may need to be reconfigured. clustered systems must be upgraded to 2009.q2.5.0 or later before upgrading to 2009.q3.1.0. dhneilson says: i was going to upgrade to the 2009.q3.0.0 release since we use iscsi extensively... log in to add a comment or watch this page.

T	strauss deserves recognition - swann - lynn news
C	 andrew strauss can cap a great first year as england captain by being recognised on the world stage on thursday night. strauss, 32, has been shortlisted for both cricketer of the year and test player of the year at the international cricket council's awards ceremony at the sandton convention centre. "he deserves recognition," said england colleague graeme swann. "he took over at a ridiculous time in english cricket with the pantomime that was going on, and the circus that was following us around at the time, and he's done an admirable job." english cricket was in disarray in january when he stepped into the breach for the tour of the caribbean, following the demise of kevin pietersen and then coach peter moores. in just over nine months, however, strauss has steadied the ship, overseen an ashes victory and is on the eve of a champions trophy semi-final against australia. swann added: "he has led from the front, he's a very calm and reassuring leader to have. he has led with dignity and done everything right in his tenure so far. so it's just desserts that he is up there. his batting has also gone through the roof." fast bowler graham onions is england's other player in contention for a gong, having been named in the emerging cricketer of the year category. onions featured in england's opening victories in group b which sealed their last-four tussle with australia at centurion on friday. few could have envisaged the turnaround in england's fortunes, however, after witnessing their performances of the 6-1 defeat against the australians last month. "that's what makes us exciting though, isn't it?" swann said, in his customary playful manner. "the first few games in england we were awful and knew we were awful. but over here something has clicked, i have no idea what it is, there has been no inspiring team talk or special, magic moment, or meeting with a guru, anything like that." copyright pa sport 2009, all rights reserved

T	us loosens grip on internet controls - news, gadgets & tech - the independent
C	email the u.s. government and the body in charge of assigning internet addresses signed an agreement on wednesday that allows for greater global participation in the internet domain name process. the u.s. commerce department said it reached an agreement with internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann), drawing praise from u.s. lawmakers, who wanted more trademark protections, and companies and international officials seeking greater independence from u.s. control. the agreement, which allows icann to become a "private sector led organization," subjects icann to periodic reviews by a panel that includes a u.s. representative and independent experts, essentially allowing the organization to no longer report solely to the united states. ending an 11-year partnership with the u.s. department of commerce, the pact also provides stability for companies such as verisign inc (vrsn.o) and go daddy that sell domains and maintain extensions like ".com". it also comes months after the european union said icann should be delinked from the u.s. government and made fully independent. "the pie actually became bigger" for greater involvement from other governments, said larry strickling, administrator of the commerce department's national telecommunications and information administration, who signed the agreement. before the signing the u.s. government wanted certain conditions -- largely driven by concerns from lawmakers -- to be met, including keeping icann a nonprofit organization headquartered in the united states. in support of the deal, u.s. representative rick boucher, chairman of the house energy and commerce subcommittee on communications, technology, and the internet, said icann has promised it will address various issues, including consumer protection and trademark matters, before implementing new domain names. "this agreement gives international stakeholders an even more powerful voice in our activities moving forward," icann chief executive rod beckstrom said in a statement. set up in 1998, icann was operating under the aegis of the commerce department, an arrangement that raised concerns by some that said the internet is not seen as belonging to a wider global constituency. it decides on what names can be added to the internet's top level domains (tlds) such as .com as well as country designations. the california-based organization has been in the spotlight over whether or not it should include .xxx for pornographic websites. in 2007, it rejected a petition to include that extension as a tld. in 2008 internet regulators voted to relax rules on domain names such as .com or .edu, paving the way for companies or individuals to create an array of new addresses for the web. under the new system, individuals, companies or groups could apply to have any string of letters established as a domain name. it could be a vanity name, for example -- .smith -- or a category name such as .sports or .perfume. a company could also change its domain to reflect its brand, so apple.com could become apple.mac, for instance. vint cerf, google's vice president & chief internet evangelist -- known as the "father of the internet" --said the pact fulfills a long-standing objective which is to "create an organization that can serve the world's interest in a robust, reliable and interoperable internet." even with the looser relationship, the u.s. government will take part in reviews of icann, which is expected to start taking hundreds of applications for new tlds early next year. a survey conducted by the future laboratory earlier this year showed that two-thirds of businesses were unaware they will be able to use their own name in place of domain extensions such as .com, .org or .net when internet domains are liberalized next year. with a fee of more than $100,000, applications are expected to be limited to large corporations and organizations. key u.s. lawmakers who had previously raised concerns praised the agreement. boucher said the agreement will ensure transparency and accountability from icann and include periodic reviews of icann's performance.

T	zimmeri mcneal convicted of killing 61-year-old aurora woman - news - metro aurora - aurora sentinel
C	 zimmeri mcneal convicted of killing 61-year-old aurora woman by brandon johansson the aurora sentinel aurora | an adams county jury this week convicted a 63-year-old aurora man of killing and sexually assaulting a 61-year-old woman in march. the jury handed down the verdict against zimmeri claudius mcneal late monday, according to prosecutors. the jury began deliberating early monday afternoon after hearing closing arguments from mcneal's defense team and prosecutors. mcneal was convicted of multiple charges, including first-degree murder, sexual assault and robbery in connection with the slaying of catherine bermudez. he is scheduled for sentencing friday morning. because the first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, the hearing is largely a formality. mcneal has been in the adams county jail since police arrested him in the minutes after bermudez's slaying march 22. according to court documents, seconds before they arrested mcneal, police officers saw him drag a dead woman's blood-soaked body down a north aurora alley. when he saw the officers, mcneal dropped the body, later identified as bermudez, and tried to walk away, according to an arrest affidavit filed by police. when officers took him into custody, mcneal's dress shoes and his pants had blood on them, police said. police have said since mcneal's arrest that they aren't sure what, if any, relationship there was between mcneal and bermudez before her death. the arrest affidavit also leaves that question unanswered. but the affidavit does paint a strange picture of mcneal's behavior that night. according to the affidavit, police responded to the 1600 block of paris street on a report of a man and woman fighting. there, officers found mcneal, wearing a t-shirt, brown hat, green and gray dress pants and carrying a walking stick. mcneal approached the officers and told them that he had been drinking at a nearby bar that night and when he was walking home, two men attacked him and tried to rob him. he told officers that he fought the men off and may have stabbed one of them. then he gave the officers the knife he said he used and told them he was going to go to his cousin's nearby home. the officers began searching for the men who mcneal said robbed him. as two officers searched an alley between paris street and peoria street, they heard what sounded like someone dragging something along the ground and turned to see mcneal dragging a woman's body in the alley. after putting mcneal in handcuffs, police checked bermudez's body for a pulse and could not find one. paramedics pronounced her dead in the alley a short time later. she had a stab wound to her throat and to her chest, and her jeans and underwear had been pulled down around her ankles. nearby, officers found a large pool of blood in a parking lot and a blood trail leading to bermudez's body. police found bermudez's keys on mcneal and her purse a short distance away. when police placed mcneal in a nearby patrol car and placed bags on his hands to preserve evidence, he told officers that "he had already washed his hands." mcneal then told officers that he was having chest pains and he was rushed to a nearby hospital. reader comments the following are comments from the readers. in no way do they represent the view of aurorasentinel.com. do not use usernames or passwords from your financial accounts! copyright © 2009 aurora sentinel. all rights reserved. unauthorized reproduction is prohibited. aurora sentinel 14305 e. alameda ave. 2nd floor

C	 police: man kills 3 children with ax in zimbabwe's most brutal crime in recent years associated press 11/01/09 7:35 am est harare, zimbabwe - zimbabwe's state media say a man allegedly killed three of his children with an ax and wounded two others in what police describe as zimbabwe's most brutal crime in recent years. the sunday mail newspaper quotes police as saying elmon mupombwa, 41, also torched his home in eastern zimbabwe on thursday and killed his livestock - five cattle, 20 goats and 17 chickens - before hanging himself. it said the dead children were aged 11, 7 and 5. their two siblings were in critical condition at a local hospital. police said mupombwa had attended a tribal ritual conducted by a spirit medium, also known as a witch doctor. the nation's economic and political turmoil has seen a rise in the use witchcraft and tribal sects to allay hardships. glenn harlan reynolds: it's the follow-through that matters in new york's special race put another postseason win in pettitte's column: handy andy pitches, hits yankees over phils what curse? new cubs owner tom ricketts promises to turn losers into world series winners publisher withholds electronic edition of tennis great agassi's explosive memoir

C	 from the snack-is-going-to-be-on-the-floor-today dept. background: url(//a.fsdn.com/sd/firehose/007/244/654-1-thumb.png); width:130px; height:97px; idle researchers from the school of medicine at the university of california have shown that the more germs a child is exposed to, the better their immune system in later life. their study found that keeping a child's skin too clean impaired the skin's ability to heal itself it could be that the process of cleansing is itself stressful to the skin when carried to excess. it could be that the process of cleansing is itself stressful to the skin when carried to excess. this has been understood for at least several decades. when i was in college, back in the late 60s and early 70s, a doctor diagnosed my dry, cracked skin and ongoing rashes as the result of too many showers. he recommended only one or two showers a week, with the qualification that any heavy exercise that produced sweating could probably be followed by a shower. i tried following his advice, and the problems cleared up. his explanation is that soap doesn't just clear away dirt and micro-organisms; it also removes surface skin cells and destroys oils, and this isn't too good for the skin. the article says specifically what they are referring to. from tfa: "the san diego-based team discovered that normal bacteria that live on the skin trigger a pathway that helps prevent inflammation when we get hurt. these bugs dampen down overactive immune responses which can cause cuts and grazes to swell, or lead to rashes, according to research published in the online edition of nature medicine." it might get the kid exposed to parasite. not only does the kid get preventive antibodies ready to be used in case of real parasites invasion (just like with bacteria as in the above explanation), it might as well diminish risks of allergy. as far as the hypothesis goes : - people exposed to parasite : 100% of them make adapted anti-bodies (ige) and prepares mast-cells, ready to use in case of real parasite invasion. - people never exposed to parasite : in most of people : nothing happens, the part of the immune system responsible for parasite response (ige antibodies and mast cells) just sits idle. no allergy happens. in unlucky people with genetic predispositions : out of "bordom" is it doesn't have anything else to do, the system start to attack random mostly innocent stuff, which are just mildly irritating but have nothing to do with actual parasites. the body creates ige targeted toward food or to animals' saliva, and has mast-call equipped against that. unlike a real parasite (which is an animal, and thus can only exist in a single point of the body - well, ok : unless it's two specimen, in which case they are in 2 points, but you got the main idea), the target substance is soluble or is a liquide and can diffuse across the whole body. thus the mast-cell don't react only locally at the single point(s) where the paraiste(s) is/are, but react everywhere in the body, creating systemic symptoms => i would expect that this would place a strong selective pressure on immune function. as such, i would think that you would expect the trend to continue in the children of families from such areas and transplanted them into a cleaner culture. i would expect that this would place a strong selective pressure on immune function. as such, i would think that you would expect the trend to continue in the children of families from such areas and transplanted them into a cleaner culture. >>for years it's been known that kids from third world countries usually don't suffer from auto-immune diseases and things akin because of the sickly environment they are exposed too. it's simple, if you live constantly with the risk of infection your body will build up a stronger immune system than someone who lives in a bubble. i practically never get sick and i have no known allergies. as a child, i dug in mud, i explored forests, i ate earth and worms and all kinds of crap. perhaps that's the reason. it seems to have been forgotten. i don't know if its because my parents immigrated from another country, but they have a different view on health than the average american. growing up, medicine from the pharmacy was the last resort to treat anything, with some important exceptions. if i had a headache, lay down, don't read or play a video game, go to sleep if you can, wait it out. a stomach ache - some toast and tea, and then see if you can go poopie. sore throat - my mom makes this stuff out of egg yolks, lemon and sugar. maybe its a placebo. also, every blue moone she would aslo give me a half shot or quarter shot of this high proof plum brandy/whiskey, "to kill the gems" a cold - hot tea, garlic toast, bedrest. chest congestion - vicks vapor-rub type hing applied to my chest left on overnight. when things were real bad, like being sick and not getting better, or having high fevers, then i would go to the doctor, get examined, and be given penicillin. thats about the only thing i got regularly as a child. flash forward to adulthood. i am 30 now. i haven't been sick since i was 23 or 24, and before that it was some time in high school. i don't get seasonal flus. i don't get colds. i get a headache two or three times a year. i get a runny nose a few times a year (usually at the same time people are getting really sick with whatever is going around at the moment). i get sore throats and congestion, but i'm never sure if that is the cigarette smoking or something else. all in all, for someone that does not live a particularly healthy lifestyle, i'm doing pretty damn good. knock on wood. i don't get seasonal flus. i don't get colds. i get a headache two or three times a year. i get a runny nose a few times a year (usually at the same time people are getting really sick with whatever is going around at the moment). i get sore throats and congestion, but i'm never sure if that is the cigarette smoking or something else. eh, it has nothing to do with where you're from. my family is pretty much the same way, and i'm at least a 4th generation american. we don't even own a themometer. my opinion is that your body hurts for a reason, and taking pills to mask the symptoms is only going to make you unaware when you're hurting it more. i caught the flu a couple weeks ago from my girlfriend, and the strongest medicine i used was some asprin, and only because my joints were aching too much to sleep. other than that i just took lots of tea, crackers, and juice. >> toast is a bad idea though. as it is nearly pure starch. meaining it will frag your immune system even further human beings are well adapted to most common bacteria, adjusting immune responses to a ancient equalibrium created by evolution. the problem is that we haven't had time to adapt to antibacterial soap, everything we eat carefully sanitized, and constant cleanliness. except the limits that kept that diet workable aren't in place any more. first of all, if you're an average citizen of an industrialized nation, you can easily obtain far more food than you require without exerting significant physical effort. that's different from only eating what you can catch and/or collect. second, you probably expect to live a lot longer than your distant ancestors. you are therefore susceptible to a lot of consequences of malnutrition or obesity that an ancient hunter/gatherer would never survive long enough to face. related to your point: "the pleasure trap: mastering the hidden force that undermines health & happiness" [amazon.com] "learn how to escape the dietary pleasure trap!" [healthpromoting.com] """ from the perspective of our natural history, a daily life with such dietary choices is extraordinary. for hundreds of thousands of years, our ancient ancestors scratched and scraped, struggling against the harsh forces of nature in order to get enough food to survive. even today, in undeveloped countries, significant food shortages are still a great concern, with millions dying each year from starvation. yet, in a mere blink of history's eye--in just a few decades--industrialized societies have arisen from environments of scarcity and have transformed themselves into societies of unprecedented abundance. the most striking feature of that abundance is a virtually unlimited supply of food. an abundance of food, by itself, is not a cause of health problems. but modern technology has done more than to simply make food perpetually abundant. food also has been made artificially tastier. food is often more stimulating than ever before--as the particular chemicals in foods that cause pleasure reactions have been isolated--and artificially concentrated. these chemicals include fats (including oils), refined carbohydrates (such as refined sugar and flour), and salt. meats were once consumed mostly in the form of wild game--typically about 15% fat. today's meat is a much different product. chemically and hormonally engineered, it can be as high as 50% fat or more. ice cream is an extraordinary invention for intensifying taste pleasure--an artificial concoction of pure fat and refined sugar. once an expensive delicacy, it is now a daily ritual for many people. french fries and potato chips, laden with artificially-concentrated fats, are currently the most commonly consumed "vegetable" in our society. these artificial products, and others like them, form the core of the american diet. our teenage population, for example, consumes 25% of their calories in the form of soda pop! most of our citizenry can't imagine how it could be any other way. to remove (or dramatically reduce) such products from america's daily diet seems intolerable--even absurd. most people believe that if they were to do so, they would enjoy their food--and their lives--much less. indeed, most people believe that they literally would suffer if they consumed a health-promoting diet devoid of such indulgences. but, it is here that their perception is greatly in error. the reality is that humans are well designed to fully enjoy the subtler tastes of whole natural foods, but are poorly equipped to realize this fact. and like a frog sitting in dangerously hot water, most people are being slowly destroyed by the limitations of their awareness. """ personally, i feel many hunter/gatherers twenty thousand years ago may have lived longer and better than some people say they did (even as things got worse with rising population, competition, and agriculture). it really depends on where exactly they lived in what time period and what the local climate was like. there are places and times where six foot and taller skeletons were common, like on the shores of inland places that had big lakes. many hunter/gatherers twenty thousand years ago may have lived longer and better than some people say they did and the corollary is... a dirty old man is a healthy old man. this is why i plan on mounting mirrors and/or cameras on both my cane and my shoetips. this is why, as an old man, i will take a volunteer job on a college campus somewhere in florida. this is why, as an old man, i plan to be a huge supporter of high school sports, standing on the sidelines with my hands in my pockets. of course nobody listened to me, and i doubt anyone will listen to this study either. they'll just keep cleaning their kid. . . . front porch. when i dump it on those damn kids, they get off my lawn, without me saying a word . . . . . . and i'm doing something good for their health. hey, maybe this a good idea for the new government health plan. i'm not a "dirty" person, but i also don't wash my hands all the time (of course i do after taking a crap, but thats a bit different). antibacterial soaps have only landed us in more trouble, since the bacteria left are resistant to them. i do like the idea of the new alcohol based cleaners though, since they aren't antibacterial. i don't stress out about making sure my pork is cooked all the way through, i don't scrub down my kitchen with bleach every day, and i also never get sick. ...i'd get the flu with hallucinations-inducing fevers. speaking as a 35 year old who regularly played in the dirt during my childhood, i'd have to anecdotally agree with this study. as and adult, i get sick about once ever four or five years. however, much like sports training or academic studying, work + rest = results. anyone who trains without rest will eventually over-train and become weaker. the same can be applied to studying, and most likely the the immune system. the top scientist is r gallo at the dept of dermatology, univ california san diego. i couldn't find a mention on his web site, but the link below lists all his pubished papers. from the abstracts, i would speculate that the idea is something like this the normal skin bacteria - the microflora - secrete various antimicrobials peptides, that is compounds which are toxic to other bacteria. if you wash to much, you don't have the right peptides on your skin. at th bottom is an abstract from a recent paper [nih.gov] from this, the following article appears to have the clearest abstract: j allergy clin immunol. 2009 sep;124(3 suppl 2):r13-8. antimicrobial peptides and the skin immune defense system. schauber j, gallo rl. department of dermatology and allergology, ludwig-maximilians-university, munich, germany. our skin is constantly challenged by microbes but is rarely infected. cutaneous production of antimicrobial peptides (amps) is a primary system for protection, and expression of some amps further increases in response to microbial invasion. cathelicidins are unique amps that protect the skin through 2 distinct pathways: (1) direct antimicrobial activity and (2) initiation of a host response resulting in cytokine release, inflammation, angiogenesis, and reepithelialization. cathelicidin dysfunction emerges as a central factor in the pathogenesis of several cutaneous diseases, including atopic dermatitis, in which cathelicidin is suppressed; rosacea, in which cathelicidin peptides are abnormally processed to forms that induce inflammation; and psoriasis, in which cathelicidin peptide converts self-dna to a potent stimulus in an autoinflammatory cascade. recent work identified vitamin d3 as a major factor involved in the regulation of cathelicidin. therapies targeting control of cathelicidin and other amps might provide new approaches in the management of infectious and inflammatory skin diseases. pmid: 19720207 [pubmed - indexed for medline] an article of interest "you really don't plan to shake my hand without washing yours first, do you?" if god had meant us to live naked in a cave with no fire while hunter-gathering, he wouldn't have given us these big brains that can figure out how to make clothes and shoes and houses and fire and fridges and supermarkets and big screen tvs. i have two kids in daycare and i bike to work. (biking gets mud and puddle water on my face regularly.) i also scuba dive, and we don't treat our sewage here. (primary screening, but no secondary treatment.) i love rare meat. there is probably more to it than just that. people think, for whatever reason, that being cold is the reason they would catch a cold...virus. they continue thinking so in spite of the common knowledge that one can catch a cold in 100+ degree temperatures in the day. some things such as colder temperatures can and will put the body's systems under stress, but if you are reasonably healthy, you will likely be fine and be able to resist a cold virus. with that said, meats that have been mishandled will tend to contain bacteria that could lead to food poisoning. completely raw meat that has been handled carefully will never lead to food poisoning. in the past, the act of cooking food was a means to rid it of any infectious diseases or to otherwise make it edible. today cooking still serves that purpose but is also something of an art form in which cooking with heat is varied and handled in a wide variety of ways. it is well known that sashimi meats from a variety of sources including beef is fairly common. my point is that it is actually the handling of the food that leads to problems with food and that proper handling can prevent many of the problems that cooking with heat are there to resolve. i feel pretty sure that my discussion here will not change your mind as a great deal of your belief is based on illness and other bad experiences from childhood and those tend to run pretty deep in the psyche. (this is why it's pretty hard to convince most religious people that modern day religions are no different from any other and are especially similar to even the most silly sounding myths.) but since you are here on slashdot, there is a pretty good chance you have a rational and logical core and will analyze the obvious facts before you. "i love rare meat. there is probably more to it than just that." my parents were not very good about food safety and force fed me undercooked meat on a regular basis. seriously, i don't know what they teach in nursing school, but every nurse i've ever met was a freak about cleanliness they're right only for a limited subset of microbes that people in hospitals are susceptible to. your body is full of "microbes" already. what makes things like staph dangerous is open wounds and weakened immune systems... the sort of thing you generally only see in hospitals. washing your hands at home because you touched a stick in the back yard is obsessive, not sensible. linux: because a pc is a terrible thing to waste -- ksh@cis.ufl.edu put this on tshirts in '93

C	 best christmas gift idea 2009 - wine gift exclusively from yats wine cellars latest news from christmas gift ideas best christmas gift idea - vintage wine from yats wine celllars one of the most challenging things to do is choose a gift for someone who has everything. actually it is not as difficult as many would think. and here is the good news - you don't have to spend nearly as much as you fear. the solution is wine of course, but not ordinary expensive wines but wines that the recipient is very unlikely to have in his/her cellar. taking the trouble to find and acquire such a unique wine gift conveys the right kind of message. to do so, one has to steer away from the obvious big names like petrus, romanee conti, grance, opus one and vega sicilia. a wealthy wine collector probably has cases of these from all kinds of rare vintages. so what kind of wines do we send to such a person? there are a number of possibilities. it could be a birth-year vintage, meaning a wine that came from the same year as the birth year of the recipient. that's pretty cute but depending on the particular year in question, it may not be all that unique. another possibility is to choose a wine from a pretty obscure but good region. consider a chateau grillet (chateau what?) which is the smallest region in the world, containing just one producer. this is a very rare sweet wine, something that even the most avid collector might have overlooked. there are other hidden gems to choose from also. very very old vintage wine is another option if price is not a big issue. there are many more options and staff of yats wine cellars are happy to help you find that special gift for that special person who happens to have everything a person could want from life. yats wine cellars has not failed to accomplish that yet. also available from yats wine cellars are cuban cigars, champagne, single malt whiskeys, armagnac, cognac, wine glasses, decanters. rabbit cork screws and other wine accessories. 3003c east tower, phil stock exchange center, yats international philippines opens wine shop called clark wine center, a leading wine supplier in the philippines, established in 2000 to address the requirement of a growing population of wine enthusiasts in the philippines. christmas gift idea 11/29/2009 philippines wine supplier known for its line of fine vintage wines, yats wine cellars was established in 2000 to address the requirement of a growing population of wine enthusiasts in the philippines. top 3 christmas gift ideas 2009 - wine gift exclusively from yats wine cellars 11/29/2009 yats wine cellars specializes helping you find something that will impress any person regardless of how wealthy he/she is.

C	 svg support on many browsers, including internet explorer, firefox, and safari. using the library plus native svg support you can instantly target ~95% of the existing installed web base. once dropped in you get partial support for svg 1.1, svg animation (smil), fonts, video and audio, dom and style scripting through javascript, and more in about a 60k library. your svg content can be embedded directly into normal html 5 or through the object tag. if native svg support is already present in the browser then that is used, though you can override this and have the svg web toolkit handle things instead. no downloads or plugins are necessary other than flash which is used for the actual rendering, so it's very easy to use and incorporate into an existing web site. please keep in mind that svg web is in alpha. if you find something file an draggable photos demo (scripted with javascript + svg image tag) falling blocks game; shows direct embedding svg into normal non-xhtml html 5 and then scripting it with normal javascript simple 'hello world' showing how to direct embed svg into normal, non-xhtml html 5 simple 'hello world' showing how to use the object tag (including for ie) to embed svg simple sample showing how to direct embed multiple svg into your page simple sample showing how to embed multiple svg objects into your page and then style them with css demo viewer; keep in mind that not all of the demos in the demo viewer work. quick start guide. also, if you are using svg web in your own project please add yourself to the november 23rd, 2009: new release just in time for thanksgiving is another svg web release. our tradition is to name svg web releases after monsters from d&d just to increase the geek factor, so in that spirit our release name this time is "gelatinous cube": the gelatinous cube is a truly horrifying creature: "a gelatinous cube looks like a transparent ooze of mindless, gelatinous matter in the shape of a cube. it slides through dungeon corridors, absorbing everything in its path, digesting everything organic and secreting non-digestible matter in its wake. contact with its exterior can result in a paralyzing electric shock, after which the cube will proceed to slowly digest its stunned and helpless prey." fun times. highlights of this release, thanks to many many people helping with patches, bug testing, and more: loads of important bugs fixed performance improvements you can now dynamically create new svg root tags all the namespace aware functions now implemented: setattributens, getattributens, etc. you can now clone svg nodes (clonenode) you can now right-click on the svg when using flash to view the dynamic updated svg source running getelementsbytagnamens scoped to a particular node now works, such as mygroup.getelementsbytagnamens(svgns, 'text') and much much more the full list of issues fixed: issue 358 : opera throws exception on patch to currenttranslate issue 413 : implement node.getelementsbytagnamens scoped by container node issue 401 : currenttranslate.setxy does translate the svg, but doesn't affect currenttranslate.getx or gety issue 384 : make sure ownerdocument defaults to 'document' issue 386 : implement hasattributens and hasattribute issue 387 : implement removeattributens and removeattribute issue 202 : programmatically creating the svg node issue 335 : specific svg file crashes browser when used with svg web issue 364 : onload event does not fire when image url is a security error issue 362 : dynamically applied color should cascade issue 349 : gradients with bounding box cooordinates are positioned wrongly on circles issue 371 : linear gradients incorrectly start at left of screen rather than each circle issue 367 : flash blend mode used for groups is a performance problem and can be avoided generally issue 331 : animations based on events not implemented; problems with transform animations issue 275 : add view dynamic source to context menu issue 297 : aspect resolution of viewbox not honored on resize of browser issue 238 : svgimagenode.as should absorb exceptions due to invalid image url issue 337: https generates insecure warning with ie6 (fixed for ie7 and ie8) issue 361 : text label is stealing mouse click october 12th, 2009: new release yowsers! it's another release of svg web, this time code named beholder: according to the classic d&d monster manual, the beholder is an "aggressive and avaricious spherical monster that is most frequently found underground." in other words, you don't want to bump into this guy in a back alley. this release, roughly about 1 month of work, has contributions from many users and developers. we've knocked out a bunch of bugs and features. the full release list: issue 327 : patching currenttranslate in causes error in wikipedia pan and zoom tool issue 326 : update config.html tool to test for svg mime type issue 316 : background svg is not being re-drawn on secondary pages for some browsers issue 307 : window resize handler can sometimes throw exceptions on ie if flash not ready issue 308 : implement currenttranslate and currentscale and have it be a fast path issue 312 : for shelley powers: odd error when using within xhtml document: works with firefox, does not work with any other browser issue 233 : (regression) inconsistent size, spacing, flow of rendering issue 304 : tspan-tag ignore s coordinates of upper text-tag issue 305 : changing shapes and paths from 'hidden' to 'visible' does not work. issue 306 : regression in test_js1.html: text that should be hidden is not issue 311 : summation of transform causes shaking and invalid transformations. issue 254 : lamb animation sample doesn't look correct issue 315 : reduce the number of sprites created per node to increase performance issue 321: support for animating path "d" attribute (except interpolation) issue 325 : support data: url scheme for object tag issue 329 : in flash renderer, images get cropped if they are moved programmatically issue 330 : in flash renderer, fill with image pattern does not work (programmatically) issue 293 : position of image differs in native vs flash issue 207 : doing transform on image dynamically throws exception issue 343 : support on * events in svg "use" element. issue 344 : cache image requests for same file september 16th, 2009: new release!

T	saying no, no, no instead of ho-ho-ho - nytimes.com
C	 saying no, no, no to the ho-ho-ho comments sign in to e-mail print single page reprints by hilary stout published: december 23, 2009 it was beginning to look a lot like christmas . so what was a good, compassionate, environmentally conscious guy like dan nainan to do? skip to next paragraph enlarge this image gary hovland andrea mohin/the new york times unornamented dan nainan in the corner of his manhattan apartment where his christmas tree could have gone. the tree was the first problem. "you cut down a tree and you're going to throw it out in three weeks," he said. "if you get a plastic tree, you're wasting petroleum." then there was the whole matter of buying gifts. "i think it's great that people are going out and buying things and helping the economy," he said. but when a wal-mart employee can be trampled to death in a manic dash for holiday bargains, as happened last year, "that kind of crystallized everything for me." the answer: skip it. the whole holiday. no tree. no stockings, carols or any of the "whole nine yards" of trappings and traditions that mr. nainan said his family has always laid on. "instead of buying stuff for people who don't need it and will probably return it anyway, i'm going to take all the money that i would have spent on presents, find some needy people - not a charity - and give the money directly to them," said mr. nainan, 28 years old and single, who, belying his earnestness and world-saving inclinations, is a professional comedian. he planned to spend christmas day working on his web site, trolling facebook and taking an elderly woman who lives in his manhattan apartment building out for dinner. this has been a year for paring back christmas. largely by economic necessity, many people have been trimming their gift lists, subduing their celebrations and aiming for a simpler, lower-key holiday. but some, like mr. nainan, are taking that sentiment to the extreme. for them, this is the year of the anti-christmas, the year when everything - from the pressure to find the perfect present to the prospect of family drama over roast turkey - just got to be too much. in response, they are opting out of the festivities entirely. this year, they are taking a holiday from the holiday. "w.w.b.j.d.?" asked richard laermer. (that is, what would baby jesus do?) "sit it out." mr. laermer, a media consultant and the author of "2011: trendspotting for the next decade," and his partner of 20 years have long celebrated christmas elaborately. but 2009 was so disappointing economically, politically and spiritually, he says, that the holidays aren't worth celebrating. the couple will spend christmas day watching "i dream of jeannie" episodes on dvd and taking dips in their pool in la quinta, calif. one year ago today, pepper hill was preparing to host her annual christmas eve open house. her atlanta home was decked in lights. her christmas tree was beautiful. twenty minutes before the guests were due, she had a sense of dread in the pit of her stomach. "wow," she said to herself. "i can never do this again." ms. hill, a 50-year-old voice-over actress, said she had been feeling a spiritual drift away from christmas for several years. and yet, each december she continued to go through the motions of sending out holiday cards, decorating the house, buying gifts. this year as december approached, she wondered if she'd have the nerve to shun the rituals that had always been a part of her life. she did. "it was so liberating!" she said. on christmas morning, ms. hill and her husband were planning to wake up in their christmas-tree-free home, get in the car, drive to a mountain and go for a hike. they hope they won't see another soul on the trail. they'll have breakfast at one of those chains along the interstate, probably the only culinary option open on christmas day in georgia. in the afternoon, they'll go to the movies. she wants to see the new meryl streep film, "it's complicated." then - because we all know that, whether you celebrate it or not, christmas can be a long day - they'll probably stay for a second movie ("maybe something heavy like 'a single man,' " she said). though ms. hill's transformation may be dramatic, there are indicators that christmas revelry in general may be slipping among the population at large. the christmas spirit foundation, a charity that provides holiday assistance to needy children and sends christmas trees to military families, has been examining people's plans for the holidays for the last five years. this year's survey, conducted by the polling firm harris interactive, found that while 95 percent of households plan to celebrate christmas (about the same as every year), the percentage of families who plan to exchange gifts is dropping: 77 percent this year, down from 85 percent in 2005. slightly fewer people said they were going to attend parties or listen to christmas music, too. another organization hired harris to conduct a different type of christmas poll - this one on holiday stress. the survey, commissioned by breakthrough at caron, a residential program for adults suffering from drug and alcohol addiction as well as dysfunctional family situations, found holiday stress to be almost universal - 90 percent of respondents said they suffered from it - but that this year the feeling was amplified. thirty-eight percent of the people polled said they expected to feel more anxiety this holiday season than last. most blamed the economy, but 77 percent also cited family conflicts. "there's a lot of pain associated with christmas," said hank stuever, the author of a new book, "tinsel: a search for america's christmas present," which follows the yuletide preparations of three families in a sprawling dallas suburb over three consecutive years, 2006 to 2008. "there's a lot of joy, too. you're supposed to be happy - thank you, charles dickens - and when you aren't, you feel bad." 1 2 next page » more articles in fashion & style » a version of this article appeared in print on december 24, 2009, on page e1 of the new york edition.

C	 terry pratchett sir terry pratchett will use a prestigious lecture today to say that the "time is really coming" for assisted suicide to be legalised. the author's comments come after two polls found that a majority of people want assisted death to be allowed for the terminally ill. sir terry, who will give the richard dimbleby lecture, will propose that a tribunal should be set up where seriously patients can apply for help to die. a legal expert in family affairs and a doctor who had dealt with serious, long-term illness would be part of the body. the best-selling author, who has alzheimer's disease, laid out his ideas in the wake of two high-profile assisted death cases. kay gilderdale was acquitted of attempted murder after helping her daughter, who was paralysed by me, to end her life. but frances inglis was jailed for a minimum of nine years for murder and attempted murder because she gave her brain-damaged son tom a heroin overdose. a yougov poll commissioned by the daily telegraph found that 75% of 2,053 people questioned wanted the law changed to allow assisted suicide, which is currently a crime. the liverpool daily post, the best source for liverpool fc, everton fc and liverpool news. your liverpool daily post, great local images, videos and your local stories.

didn't live long enough to tell. cons: had to rma this after only about three hours of use. i've installed lots of drives, but never had one fail this quickly. reading the reviews it seems that wd has its fare share of early failures. thanks for the valuable feedback you provided! tech level: somewhat high - ownership: 1 month to 1 year this user purchased this item from newegg pros: it still works after a month, something i can't say for a lot of drives i got doa or that died quickly tech level: somewhat high - ownership: 1 week to 1 month this user purchased this item from newegg pros: worked perfectly and seemed to add quite a bit of zip to my aging hp350. more so than the new video card. features high performance electronics architecture dual processor - twice the processing power to maximize performance. 32 mb cache - bigger, faster cache means faster performance. rock solid mechanical architecture stabletrac - the motor shaft is secured at both ends to reduce system-induced vibration and stabilize platters for accurate tracking, during read and write operations. notouch ramp load technology - the recording head never touches the disk media ensuring significantly less wear to the recording head and media as well as better drive protection in transit. compatible - we perform tests on hundreds of systems and a multitude of platforms in our fit lab™ and mobile compatibility lab to give our customers confidence that our drives will work in their systems ideal for power computing applications such as multimedia, video and photo editing, and maxed out gaming computers. how this wd hard drive protects your data data lifeguard is an exclusive set of data protection features, including shock protection, an environmental protection system and real-time embedded error detection and repair. wd's data lifeguard technology automatically finds, isolates, and repairs problems that may develop over the life of a hard drive. data lifeguard tools are software utilities designed for wd hard drives that work with the embedded data lifeguard features to make hard drive installation,diagnostics and repair both simple and worry-free.

T	councilman: moving elections a ruse ? maybe
C	as he suggested he would, councilman jim nelson withdrew the agenda item calling for city elections to be moved to november. league city council members are scheduled to debate the merits of moving the city's election date from may to november starting in 2011. but don't expect the discussion to last long. the agenda for tonight's meeting suggests that councilman jim nelson asked for the item to be placed on the agenda. nelson, however, said he plans on pulling the item from the agenda. nelson said the only reason he asked for the debate was to call the rest of council's bluff on putting proposed charter amendments - including one that would change the form of government in the city - on the may ballot. "i will be pulling this item unless the rest of the charter amendments are going to be on the ballot in may," nelson said in an e-mail. "this is a slight of hand by the administration, i believe, to negate the council vote of december 2007 when we voted to place four items on the next may ballot and the new council started to delay that and now we still have no vote on the charter amendments. "so, if we vote on just this issue for a charter amendment on the may ballot the other four amendments cannot be brought to the voters for another two years since the charter can only be changed every two years." even if nelson's effort is a ruse, at least one other member of council likes the idea of having city elections in the fall. one more good reason for this change would be to align local elections with national and congressional elections. we have far too many election days per year, and too many people can't be bothered to go to the polls even once or twice every two years, let alone what seems like 4 or 5 times a year. - by kevin lang on jan. 12 at 8:29 am having all elections is november is bad - people will be overwhelmed with advertising, and will just vote straight-ticket. better to have the local elections separate, and let people devote necessary time to differentiate the candidates and understand the issues. if all the elections are on the same day, it may be convenient, but voters will be more stupid then they are now! - by jackie friedman on jan. 12 at 9:31 am i'm not sure which is worse, people casting straight tickets or random checkboxes, or people not even showing up. neither is a good testimony on the democratic process. - by kevin lang on jan. 12 at 9:07 pm there's nothing wrong with having elections in the fall. © 2010 the galveston county daily news. all rights reserved.

C	port st. lucie, fl (sports network) - mets shortstop jose reyes will reportedly begin the 2010 season on the disabled list as he gets back into baseball shape following a thyroid problem. according to the new york post, his placing on the dl will be retroactive to march 26, which will make him eligible to play on april 11 against washington. reyes appeared in just one spring game before sitting out three weeks due to an overactive thyroid. he has since been cleared to play and has returned to practice, but the team wants him to get into playing shape before inserting him into the lineup. the 26-year-old is coming off a season in which he played in a career-low 36 games due to a hamstring problem. community monitors online comments

T	abstract | gene duplication and fragmentation in the zebra finch major histocompatibility complex
C	 background due to its high polymorphism and importance for disease resistance, the major histocompatibility complex (mhc) has been an important focus of many vertebrate genome projects. avian mhc organization is of particular interest because the chicken gallus gallus, the avian species with the best characterized mhc, possesses a highly streamlined minimal essential mhc, which is linked to resistance against specific pathogens. it remains unclear the extent to which this organization describes the situation in other birds and whether it represents a derived or ancestral condition. the sequencing of the zebra finch taeniopygia guttata genome, in combination with targeted bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) sequencing, has allowed us to characterize an mhc from a highly divergent and diverse avian lineage, the passerines. results the zebra finch mhc exhibits a complex structure and history involving gene duplication and fragmentation. the zebra finch mhc includes multiple class i and class ii genes, some of which appear to be pseudogenes, and spans a much more extensive genomic region than the chicken mhc, as evidenced by the presence of mhc genes on each of seven bacs spanning 739 kb. cytogenetic (fish) evidence and the genome assembly itself place core mhc genes on as many as four chromosomes with tap and class i genes mapping to different chromosomes. mhc class ii regions are further characterized by high endogenous retroviral content. lastly, we find strong evidence of selection acting on sites within passerine mhc class i and class ii genes. conclusion the zebra finch mhc differs markedly from that of the chicken, the only other bird species with a complete genome sequence. the apparent lack of synteny between tap and the expressed mhc class i locus is in fact reminiscent of a pattern seen in some mammalian lineages and may represent convergent evolution. our analyses of the zebra finch mhc suggest a complex history involving chromosomal fission, gene duplication and translocation in the history of the mhc in birds, and highlight striking differences in mhc structure and organization among avian lineages. the complete article is available as a

C	 could be the slave, master, or torn rubber hose(not likely). check for fluid in those areas. you obviously have a leak. best places to look would be below the slave cylinder or get under the dash and observe the rubber boot that the clutch rod goes into. that's a very common place for leaks. once you figure out where the leak is coming from, you can either rebuild the cylinder (master or slave) for $10 or spend $100 on a new one... your choice. rebuilding is soooooo easy and takes almost no skill to do . bleeder valve is on the slave cylinder and usually has a rubber cover on it. you can't miss it. and just do a google search next time... there's probably a thread a week on this topic. tuturial (without pictures for now) how to replace clutch master cylinder ^ very important, otherwise you will round off the nut! you may not post new threads you may not post replies you may not network consists of the largest network of enthusiast-owned enthusiast-operated automotive communities. provides the latest car reviews, auto show coverage, new car prices, and automotive news. the autoguide network operates more than 100 automotive forums where our users consult peers for shopping information and advice, and share opinions as a community.

T	post on tournament poker: 9-man stt versus 9-man steps
C	 well one difference that i would like to add is that in steps you're likely to go higher in buyin than in a regular sng. for example i started with 30 step 1s, i got a step 5, a couple of step 4s, a couple of step 3, and a couple of step 2s right now. my problem is what to do with that step 5 for example. by itself it is worth more than 2 times what i've invested so far. and while it's profitable in the long run to shove 23 in certain situations for example, for me (a person that is not playing 216$ sngs/steps regularly) what is the most profitable thing to do in these marginal situations?

T	the most disgusting thing i have ever seen
C	 really, the sheer oversexualisation of children in this is horrible. sure, they're probably talented showgirls in training (6 to 8, i think) but the fact they're being forced down this path at such an early age and with their parent's consent and the audience applauding them... ugh. it makes me ill and really degrades my view of humanity. i'm normally very libertarian, but this makes me want to lock up their parents and force them to undergo parental training. jrcb: i did not watch the video, but i saw the picture before it loaded and that was enough. who in the hell thought it was a good idea? this is the most disgusting thing i've ever seen. really, the sheer oversexualisation of children in this is horrible. sure, they're probably talented showgirls in training (6 to 8, i think) but the fact they're being forced down this path at such an early age and with their parent's consent and the audience applauding them... ugh. it makes me ill and really degrades my view of humanity. i'm normally very libertarian, but this makes me want to lock up their parents and force them to undergo parental training. how about all of you? (also, how does one embed a video on this site?) to be honest, i forget how exactly but go to a forum where they do have embedded videos and quote the posts, so you can see how by looking at the reply to thread area. and depending on the context of where the girls are at might elaborate on how this exactly was allowed to go on. [ youtube={jumble of numbers after = in url} ] i thought this was going to be about gore or something. jrcb: i did not watch the video, but i saw the picture before it loaded and that was enough. who in the hell thought it was a good idea? they're very talented. i think we have at least one example, jrcb. > the girls look like they are having a lot of fun as a dance team, so i don't see your negative points at all. , and the people are cheering because those girls can dance really well. jrcb: i did not watch the video, but i saw the picture before it loaded and that was enough. who in the hell thought it was a good idea? they're very talented. i think we have at least one example, jrcb. > .<</p> i'm not saying that the costumes and other things aren't a little too slutty for girls that age but as long as it's what the girls want to do then why should anyone stop them? again they are pretty good. that's pathetic reasoning, honestly. 'if it's what they want to do, why should they be stopped?' because it's fucking disgusting! children are stupid, and it's up to their parents to ensure they don't become stupid, slutty materialistic twats like all their pop culture role models tell them to be. yeah... i've seen a video of some guy doing a corpse mid autopsy somewhere around the net. i no longer click random links on the sides of pages for just this reason. so your video doesn't seem so bad by comparison... its totally wrong i feel you on that but its not the most disgusting thing i've seen. the saddest part of this is that they're good. steelwolf89: grow up, its the clothes they chose to wear as a team, all they really care about is having fun, period. ahhh..... behold the whore brigade in their earlier years. well, i have to say that they are pretty talented :p - but damn, those clothes are soo wrong :o oh man, i wish i could dance half as well. good lord. i can't even begin to describe my revulsion towards the parents who forced their children down this terrible path.

T	asia stocks, commodities fall on europe debt cuts, sony results - businessweek
C	 may 14 (bloomberg) -- asia stocks fell the most in a week after sony corp. forecast profit that missed analyst estimates, and copper and aluminum dropped on concern europe's debt-cutting measures will hurt economic growth, reducing demand. the msci asia pacific index declined 1.1 percent to 119.79 as of 11:45 a.m. in tokyo. crude oil slid for a fourth day. futures on the standard & poor's 500 index were little changed after the u.s. stock benchmark lost 1.2 percent yesterday. the foundations for a global recovery aren't "solid" and the sovereign-debt crisis in some countries is "deepening," chinese premier wen jiabao said last night. sony said it may suffer a "significant impact" if europe's plight spreads and forecast net income for this fiscal year that's less than half the average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by bloomberg. "investors are concerned about the potential contagion effect the debt crisis in europe will have," said rico gomez, who helps manage $1 billion at manila-based rizal commercial banking corp. "if liquidity is siphoned off as the debt problem in europe spreads, this can hurt global economic recovery." japan's nikkei 225 stock average fell 1.6 percent, the most in a week, australia's s&p/asx 200 index dropped 0.8 percent, and china's shanghai composite index, which entered a bear market earlier this week, lost 0.3 percent. sony, mazda sony, the maker of bravia televisions and cyber-shot, slumped 6.5 percent in tokyo, the most in more than year as barclays capital, goldman sachs group inc. and nomura holdings inc. cut their share-price estimates after the disappointing earnings forecast. mazda motor corp., a japanese carmaker that gets 21 percent of its sales from europe, sank 1.1 percent. bhp billiton ltd., australia's biggest oil company, retreated 1.3 percent in sydney after crude oil and copper fell. "forecasts for corporate earnings growth are likely to be revised downwards because of the debt crisis," said wu kan, a shanghai-based fund manager at dazhong insurance co., which oversees $285 million. the yen gained versus 13 of 16 major counterparts amid increased demand for japan's currency as a refuge from the european crisis. the euro touched 115.88 yen, the lowest since may 7. the yen was at 92.825 per dollar from 92.75 yesterday. "the roots of the debt crisis in europe have yet to be solved," said yoh nihei, a tokyo-based trading group manager at tokai tokyo securities co., a unit of tokai tokyo financial holdings inc.

T	bbc - gomp/arts: all about the subject, and not the artist
C	next » all about the subject, and not the artist 16:00 uk time, wednesday, 7 july 2010 a campaign to raise money from the public to go towards the total cost of £554,937.50 to buy a portrait of ayuba suleiman diallo. he's hardly a household name, but he is important. the painting according to the national portrait gallery (npg) is the first known portrait that honours a named african subject as an individual and an equal, and thereby gives a useful insight into britain in the 18th century. this statement tells you all you need to know about what makes the npg different from and, from the perspective of social history, more interesting than other art galleries. it makes clear that the sitter is more important than the artist. the npg doesn't want this painting because it's an exquisite example of 18th century british art, but because the story of the sitter and its significance is so compelling. ayuba suleiman diallo, or job ben solomon as his english friends liked to call him, was a west african slave trader. the phrase "what goes around comes around" probably wasn't in much use in those days but, had it been, perhaps the wealthy ayuba might have been more on his guard. one day on a business trip to sell some slaves down the river gambia, he suffered the indignity of being captured and enslaved himself. he was put onto a british ship bound for maryland where he was sold to work on a tobacco plantation. an english lawyer and missionary called thomas bluett met him and decided he was "no common slave", so in the early 1730s he whisked him off to london and introduced him to high society. black, muslim, highly-educated individuals were not common in those days, leading to ayuba becoming something of a celebrity. his friends arranged for a portrait to be painted of him and chose the artist william hoare of bath, a founding member of the royal academy. ayuba was a religious man and didn't really go for the idea of a portrait, worrying that people would worship the picture. or, as thomas bluett put it in his memoirs: "job's aversion to pictures of all sorts, was exceeding great; insomuch, that it was with great difficulty that he could be brought to sit for his own. we assured him that we never worshipped any picture, and that we wanted his for no other end but to jeep us in mind of him. he at last consented to have it drawn; which was done by mr hoare." in fact it is the earliest known painting by the artist. the picture was painted in 1733 and, apparently at the sitter's request, has him in traditional dress and carrying a copy of the qur'an around his neck. and since then, till now, it has not been seen in public. it was thought to be lost and was only known about though bluett's memoir, but then it turned up at auction in 2009 where it was bought by a private collector who wants to take it abroad. the exports committee stepped in and now it is on show, for all to see at the national portrait gallery, while they attempt to raise the funds to secure it for the nation. it seems likely they will, as they have already raised over £500,000 with contributions from the heritage lottery fund, the art fund and the npg's own contribution. wrote: is it actually that colour? does it need restoring or was it hoare's picasso moment; when you run out of a colour, use brown? will gompertz, the bbc's arts editor. subscribe to gomp/arts you can stay up to date with gomp/arts via these feeds.

C	 another gong for action plan 23 sep, 2010 01:36 pm it's official: council managers have been deemed to have done an excellent job at engaging the jindabyne community on its action plan. last friday the snowy river shire council beat some of the biggest metropolitan council in sydney to receive the local government managers australia nsw award for management excellence and community engagement. it is the second time the council has been recognised for its efforts in developing the jindabyne action plan that received community input from 22 per cent of the population and took two years to complete. shire director murray blackburn-smith said he was proud of liz rankin, charles litchfield and the rest of the planning team. he said the community input and councillor support also contributed to the plan's success. the awards took place at the westin hotel, sydney with the aim to recognise excellence and best practice in the local government profession. council general manager joe vescio said the action plan had impacted on the council as an organisation. "the open communication and investment in the process has resulted in the community being more confident in the organisation thereby enhancing council's reputation as a leader," a council issued press release stated. council have also heralded the success of plan as an "excellent precursor to the development of the wholeof-shire community strategic plan." consultation processes for the csp, part of the new department of local government integrated planning and reporting framework, will commence in october. nsw minister for roads david borger and federal member for eden-monaro mike kelly yesterday announced the review of environmental factors for the bega bypass is now on display. a 53-year-old tura beach man was arrested after fleeing from the scene of an accident in tura beach drive, caused when he swerved to avoid an elderly resident crossing the road. bega valley nurses helen gammell and derek tabor are the first recipients of the pat and joe mcbride scholarship. the scholarship has been generously set up by joe mcbride in memory of his wife pat. there was a frisson of excitement this week when word went round that merimbula councillor and deputy mayor michael britten was doing the numbers for a possible challenge against mayor tony allen.

T	the boy?s toilet trainer helps your little guy learn to pee standing up
C	 the boy's toilet trainer helps your little guy learn to pee standing up as i have mentioned before, i have a little girl. so, while potty training was rough and quite drawn out, i have not experienced potty training a boy. i hear that it can be even more of a challenge, especially because you have the added task of teaching your toddler how to use the toilet standing up. for anyone who is about to or currently going through this parenting rite of passage there is a new product on the market designed to make the 'standing and peeing' portion a bit more convenient. the boy's toilet trainer from tippitoes is a device that clips to the edge of most standard toilets. it gives your toddler boy a spot that is at his level to stand and pee, so that he doesn't have to climb up on a step stool first. the gadget comes with a variety of clip sizes, so that you can pick the one that best fits your toilet. it is said to be easy to lift to pour the contents into the bowl and can be rinsed clean. source: tippitoes.com

C	 a collection of south texas political gossip. essentially putting global warming science on trial, texas officials on thursday expanded their arguments in a lawsuit meant to prevent the federal regulation of greenhouse gases. in motions submitted thursday to the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit, texas attorney general greg abbott accused the federal environmental protection agency of relying on faulty science for its proposals to regulate greenhouse gases. republicans make up their own reality. isn't that called insantity

T	devan d.: memberships to comic-con 2011 are facing postponed sales
C	 comic-con 2010 is barely over, however comic-con 2011 is already on the brain. nov 1 was the first day four-day passes were supposed to go on sale. technical difficulties with sales shut down sales. the new sales date can be announced in one week. getting passes for comic-con 2011 comic-con 2011 was scheduled to start selling four-day passes today. when registration opened, nevertheless, the comic-con site overloaded. the website came back up quickly, but the registration company's website had been not processing registrations properly. after just a little bit of time, comic-con shut down registration entirely. registration partners shut down also. pre-sales to special customers were practically the only ones that were able to get their badges, which was about 13 percent of all badges. comic-con 2011 badges re-open there aren't that many 2011 comic-con 2011 badges available to be marketed. the number of memberships for the convention are always limited, and scalped comic-con badges are always of concern. a handful of the comic-con 2011 badges were sold throughout the initial registration today, however it was just a couple. in seven days followers will know when the re-opening of the registration will be, giving them additional time to plan their trips to ca. every person generating comic-con 2011 plans already the 2011 comic-con is slated for july 20 via july 24 in san diego. this is the 41st year for comic-con. not it is considered the largest science fiction/fantasy/film/television conventions within the world. the san diego convention center can hold 125,000 attendees, and it has been filled to capacity for numerous years in a row. there have been concerns about overcrowding, but the san diego convention center has a contract with comic-con until 2012. given the problems with marketing memberships to the convention and overcrowding, the importance of early preparing for attendance to comic-con 2011 is going to be incredibly important. since a regular membership does not mean you'll get to attend a presentation, they're over-sold too. info from comic book resources comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=29188

T	players' chief fears player exodus - bakewell today
C	 rugby players association chief executive damian hopley fears the prospect of an exodus of top english internationals to french clubs. england recently declared they would only select overseas-based players in "exceptional circumstances" after next year's world cup. "we want the best players playing in england and we want the best english players playing in england," said hopley. however, jonny wilkinson indicated on monday that he will extend his stay in toulon while sale are expecting andrew sheridan to join him at the end of the season. some of england's most exciting prospects such as ben foden, courtney lawes and chris ashton are also reported to have attracted interest from across the channel. hopley backs the rugby football union's position and has warned rpa's members that they must face the consequences if they do leave the aviva premiership. "there is clearly a concern that there might be an exodus of the best english players after the next world cup. we want the best english players playing in england for the next two world cups," he said. "the announcement by england was a bit heavy-handed but we believe it will force players to make a decision sooner rather than later. if this is what it takes to get the best results from england at the 2015 world cup, then that's the price players will have to pay. "they know they can go to france and get a guaranteed amount of money or they can fight for their place in england. "hopefully the profile of the game will continue to rise and that will make up for what they might earn in france." copyright pa sport 2010, all rights reserved

"the results suggest that urine with or without wood ash can be used as a substitute for mineral fertilizer to increase the yields of tomato without posing any microbial or chemical risks," the report says. all rights reserved. any reproducing of this article must have the author name and all the links intact. author: david fewster - worldwidehealth editor contact form please use this form to contact david fewster - worldwidehealth editor to avoid misuse and spamming, please enter the verification code, shown below, to send your message. thank you

T	shots news
C	 latest news from shots.net last night, associates of the advertising industry converged at hamburg's historical curio-haus to celebrate the cream of europe's crop at the 23rd annual eurobest awards. enlightened with a dip into the minds of some of the industry's elite figures in the seminars, we were there as the honourable winners were revealed, with london taking the top city gong. whatever the question is, advertising is not the answer. that's the message coming loud and clear from almost every session at this year's eurobest, as we bring you a round-up of the top seminars in hamburg. it's pretty easy to get depressed at the moment, with the daily news dominated by tales of international recession and woe. but paris-based start-up agency hello sunshine is fighting back. cannes jury presidents announced; brand new interactive media school; dubai lynx open for registration; oscar nod for sweet shop duo; felt music launches new online player; getty images' mishmash winners; refuelling with retro classics c?clope's gift to carl erik rinsch & rsa production industry big hitters gathered on the deck of the madero mystic yacht in buenos aires for friday night's inaugural c?clope international advertising craft festival awards, with rsa bagging the top prize. face to face with... johnny hardstaff johnny hardstaff is a true new age talent. with a background in graphic design, his moving image work has received worldwide critical acclaim. having just signed with sonny london for representation in europe and fresh off the back of a gold ciclope win, the live action designer/director tells us about visual stories, moving to a new home and his metaphorical creative horn. brothers and sisters sit on the fence when it comes to court cases involving appeals against death row, you're likely to find shots sitting on the fence, and in this case agency brothers and sisters are right there with us. with the skills of art collective mentalgassi, it hit london's streets for amnesty international, utilising pre-existing fences to raise awareness about a man serving life for a crime he maintains he didn't commit.

T	concert blog: dave matthews band, hershey park, 6-27-08 by andrew mcgavisk (andrew) on myspace
C	awake ok so i've only been to one dmb concert before (sad, i know.). the concert i went to last year was good. however, this year's show blew that one away. there are 3 reasons for this. first is the songs they played. last year they only played a few songs i liked, and they didn't jam out on them very much. this year, they jammed out on at least half of the songs. second reason is the seats. last year i was on the lawn outside the tweeter center. i was all the way at the front of the lawn, but that was far from center stage, row 35, like i was this year. the third reason was the presence of tim reynolds this year. if you're a fan, you know what this means. if you don't know who tim reynolds is...stop reading this, and either go buy every cd in the dave matthews section of your local store, or go shoot yourself in the face. the one thing that sucked this year was who i had stand next to this year. and no, i'm not talking about pete, that would just be mean, and besides, he was there last year. last year it was me and pete and morgan and someone else. this year it was just me and pete. so we got there early, got to our seats, and there were open seats on either side of us, and we were standing there marveling at the view we had, and i looked at the empty seats and said "these need to be hot girls." now, seeing as how i had happened to get these tickets 3 days before the concert, i should've known better. but i said it anyway. so who sits in the seats on the left of us? a giant fat guy and his slightly smaller girl. on the other side of us, say hello to the chatty old guy and his wife, both of whom were far too touchy feely for people of their age. so anyway, the moral of that story is be thankful if you have good seats that you got pretty much only by the grace of god, and don't get greedy, or god will arrange for a giant fat guy to sit on you because the seats are too close together and small for him to fit. (before i sound too terribly rude, giant fat guy was actually pretty cool. he was our age and had seen a bunch of dave shows and knew every song, and he was friendly, so it wasn't all bad. it's just that i wish he would've been a hot girl. chatty old guy, on the other hand, i could've done without. this is because most of his conversation involved him talking about awesome concerts he'd been to and how he'd seen frank zappa hundreds of times because his friend owns or runs a venue in nyc and he'd also seen dmb like 30 times and yet seemed to not know any of the songs...but on the good side, he gave us a great tip to always get good dmb seats.) and to top it off, the black crowes opened for them. i must say, they are better in person than they are on record. unfortunately they did not play hard to handle or she talks to angels, which was disappointing, but dmb made up for it. for your viewing pleasure, here is the setlist. 1. old dirt hill 2. everyday 3. you might die trying 4. eh hee 5. grey street 6. bartender...huge jam out with some piccolo-a piccolo solo, and then they played the "if i only had a brain" ending from wizard of oz. 7. corn bread 8. out of my hands featuring dave playing a piano and making a joke about a monkey he keeps inside of it...he's officially a burnt out crazy old stoner but at least he still plays phenomenally...here's the joke: 9. dancing nancies - dave gave a funny little into about hershey's canned syrup going extinct...(which can be viewed here: ...the song also featured a ridiculous jam out from boyd, which apparently happens a lot when they play this song, but anyway, it was sick. 10. typical situation - huge jam out in the middle of it 11. where are you going (apparently the answer to this was to the bathroom, there were a ton of people who used this song as a bathroom break. i should've. but i was afraid they would make this song awesome too. however, they did not.) 12. crash into me 13. jimi thing - long jam into a trumpet solo into a big ending but wait not an ending into a huge guitar solo from tim into another ending but no then it went into the crowd singing buffalo springfield's for what it's worth (stop, hey, what's that sound, everybody look what's going down) off of the band's cues, but we're really not sure if the crowd started that because they thought that's what the band was playing, or if the band wanted that to happen, but either way, it was pretty cool. 14. so damn lucky with soloes from dave and tim on guitars at the end 15. rhyme and reason 16. so much to say into a cool ending into a drum solo, then bass solo, then trumpet solo, then a jam which included... 17. anyone seen the bridge? which ran into... 18. too much encore 19. money (pink floyd cover) 20. two step - long intro, different lyrics. then at the end, another huge ending jam which ended with that famous snare drum hit that starts off the next song... kimmie okay,so yeah the black crowes- no hard to handle was a freaking shame. that and i stood in line for a freakin corona for most of their set. i didn't stay in my seats because the girls in front of us would not stop talking about jessica simpson. not joking. it was sad. we went down to the field and stood right next to a guy who exactly like a young mick jagger. okay... using the bathroom? i had to as soon as dmb took the stage but used my willpower to not go until money. yeah. i'm talented like that. i loved the cover but i figured i wouldn't want to miss the rest of the encore, which i am glad because two step is probably in my top three of my favorite songs.

T	editorial: 'better day' ahead for egyptians in fight for change | postcrescent.com | appleton post crescent
C	 your browser's security settings are preventing some features from appearing. the images coming out of egypt are breathtaking, as is the scope of the problem in that country. as more and more egyptians have taken to the streets in attempts to oust their leaders, the united states is a position that grows increasingly more complicated each day. as a country, we support democracy around the world. but we have also backed egypt's authoritarian ruler, hosni mubarak, in his 30-year tenure. president barack obama's administration used words this week to urge a change in leadership in that country. it's a step in the right direction as we champion the protestors while trying not to let our interference create more instability in the region. as obama said at thursday's national prayer breakfast in washington, "a better day will dawn over egypt and throughout the world." he's right, because the uprisings show the innate fight for freedom in all of us. one of our universal traits is that we want our government to be self-determined. it's not always a smooth process, as the violence in cairo shows. but our fight for democracy wasn't bloodless, either; the revolutionary war lasted nearly a decade. citizens in the middle east want a say in their future, though the forms of government they choose might not resemble ours. their brand of democracy could have a different feel. that's their choice. in egypt, the push for new leaders is swelling from the ground up. it's a sign the people want government to reflect their wishes and needs, and that they're not afraid to take an active role in that transition. however this ends, it's frightening yet emboldening to see how citizens can band together to oust their leaders. sign up for postcrescent.com newsletters

T	soul serenade: the rascals, "a ray of hope" | popdose
C	when it comes times to write this column every week, i never know where the inspiration is going to come from. the same can be said about all of my writing. sometimes the idea will come from hearing a song on the radio. other times i'll see a mention of a certain artist in a story, in print or online. this week, inspiration came from twitter. a number of the people that i follow on twitter like to post about what they're listening to at a given time. i like that because in many cases i'm following those people because i have respect for their musical taste. last week i was sitting around trolling on twitter when i noticed a tweet from my friend dennis corrigan (@irishjava), which said that he was listening to " a ray of hope " by the rascals on rdio . inspiration! the first thing i did was to listen to the song myself, and i was reminded once again of how great it was. i wondered how i had managed to forget such a great song for all of these years. after all, i was a major fan of the rascals back in the day, and they're still not far from my turntable much of the time. but that's the joy of talking about music with my friends - rediscovering music that i love. in my opinion, the rascals made three great albums, their first three. the greatest of them all, groovin' (1967), was also the last of them. that in no way implies that they didn't make some great music after that, but my interest waned just a tiny bit after that. it seemed to me at the time that they were moving away from the blue-eyed soul that i loved, and toward a more experimental, jazz-tinged sound. there is certainly nothing wrong with that. i just didn't want to go there with them. i suppose that's why i had managed to forget about "a ray of hope," and other great songs from the rascals post-'67 output. perhaps it's time for an overall reappraisal of a band that remains one of my favorites of all time. "a ray of hope" was released by atlantic records in late 1968. the song was written by felix cavaliere, who by then had started taking on more of the songwriting responsibilities. the team of cavaliere and eddie brigati had written many of the band's early hits, and brigati's absence in the songwriting credits at this time was one indication that some fractures were starting to appear in the band. the legendary arif mardin produced the record with cavaliere, and the equally legendary tom dowd was one of the recording engineers. "a ray of hope" was a decent-sized hit for the rascals, reaching #24 on the billboard singles chart, and #14 on cashbox , but they were near the end of their awesome run of hit singles. the song was later included on the 1969 rascals double album tom dowd this entry was posted on thursday, march 24th, 2011 at 7:30 am and is filed under music. you can follow any responses to this entry through the rss 2.0 feed.you can skip to the end and leave a response. pinging is currently not allowed.

T	fender hot rod deville 410 or 212 - telecaster guitar forum
C	fender hot rod deville 410 or 212i am thinking i might get a fender hot rod deville amp. i am thinking it will be a good fit for my needs. i have read that many people do not love the drive channel, but i use that very little anyway. i play mostly clean, and want that fender bright, clean sound. i like to have a good solid low end, but don't want to give up the mids and highs. i really like the full sound i get out of my 412 cabinet, but think the fender tube amp will give me what i am looking for. so, my question is, should i get the 212 or 410? or, would you steer me toward another amp using 6l6's in this price category? thanks!the hot rod is not a particularly bright amp. i have one, and with most of my guitars, it's just way too dark. oddly enough, when i hear someone else play through this amp -- it always sounds gorgeous. it also works really, really well with my strat that has vintage noiseless pickups. i got the 410 version, after about an hour of a-b comparison in the store, vs. the 212 model. after a while, i noticed that the 212 had an odd "ping" sound, at the start of notes.i would recommend the 410. i've used both of them, and in the series, to my ears the 4x10 devilles sound better than the 2x12 deluxes. as for other amps in this price range? have you considered the reissue 4x10 bassman?? best of luck. hunt around and try out lots of amps! wardman, you're gonna have to try both and see what you think because i have the 212 and i liked this over the 410.i can speak for the 410, owning one for about 3 years... but, i haven't played through a 212 deville. like beep.click said, they are very dark sounding, and indeed beautifully dark. they are lush cleans but they are dark. i actually really like the overdrive. it's probably the best fender does with overdrives. it does tend to be slightly muddy sounding, but i think a good bit of that is the stock "groove tube" kinda muddy.... and can be addressed w/ brighter tubes. i put a spare pair of mesa 6l6's i had around in and it brought a noticeable amount of clarity to the overdrives. lovely amp. i'm all about the cleans too though, and since i picked up a 65 twin reverb ri, that's gotten the most attention. the less attention the deville gets, the more i appreciate it though. it's definitely keeper..... but, if you haven't, you might consider a twin reverb or a super reverb if the cleans are what you're after.once upon a time, i wanted a deville, and i had the same question as you. 212 or 410? hmm... so i went to gc and lined up 5 devilles, two of the 212's, and three of the 410's. i was surprised how different they all sounded. not just differences between the 212's and 410's, but even the pair of 212's sounded different from each other. the 410's all had their own distinct tone too. that's one of the things that's interesting about tube amps. due to variations in manufacturing, different tubes - even of the same make - will sound different. to my ears, with my tele, the 410's all sounded noticably more punchy and alive than the 212's. it was pretty obvious to me. then i went back and forth between the three 410's and found the one that i thought sounded best. after i got it home, i ended up changing some of the preamp tubes and that sweetened up the tone farther still. i have noticed that people who tend to prefer the 212 models often have gibson style guitars, ymmv... used that deville 410 for a couple of years, then i got my old rk twin out of storage and the deville became a backup. i ended up selling the deville and using the money to finance another guitar. i do kind of miss it, it sounded great with a tube screamer, but i have since acquired a peavey classic 50 410. lots of folks say the peavey's sound better than the deville, but i don't think so. it's not better or worse - they just sound different. quote: originally posted by jayfreddy used that deville 410 for a couple of years, then i got my old rk twin out of storage and the deville became a backup. [applauds the love for the 'ol rk twin... chuu, chuu, chuu, whew wheu!!!]in general 12's are going to have a looser/deeper bass response, and 10's have a bit more clarity and brightness in the 2~5 khz range; which may or may not be good, depending on what you are looking for. however in the case of the deville, it may appear that the 10's crank out more bass than the 12's and this is for the most part true, mainly because there are four 10's vs only two 12's. (this is personally my limit. i'm sure several amps can make it work, but from my experience four 12's is too bassy and muddy.) it's important to note that a deeper bass response does not necessarily mean there will be more bass. it just means the bass you do hear goes into a lower frequency range.if you don't mind hauling the 410, go for it. if you can find a blues deville 410, get that instead. awesome amp!i had a 212 i bought used but personally think the 410 sounds better. i thought my deville had a weirdness to it with the upper mids. whenever i tried to eq it out, the amp would sound too thin and harsh. since you don't mind a heavy amp i would try and grab a silverface pro reverb. for a few hundred more it's 10x better.the hot rod deville is one loud amp. real loud. did i mention it was loud?4x10 moves more air so it sounds louder. great amps. as racer5 said - hauling it around is the downside. hand truck for the win, unless you have roadies.

T	router swapping question - ebay suspension & paypal limited forums
C	amazon ghost, you can get six-months free as a paid subscriber. private forums, live forum chat, larger pm box, and no pop-ups ads among other features. i just bought a couple of new belkin routers and finished connecting one of them. however, when i go to ipburger the ip is still the same. i tried re-setting it a bunch of times, tried connecting it different ways, but still get the same ip. am i suppose to do something else to make it change? i've never purchased new routers, so lets see what others have to say about this, but i have read from users who wanted dynamic ip addresses, but couldn't get them due to finding out they actually had static ip called, and requested dynamic, so maybe you can try that if all else fails, but once again i'm sure someone more experienced with this will comment, its usually slow on the weekends. check out smac 2.7 its the beta version i believe still. this program has worked like a dream for me. i wrote a short sweet little script a about 3 months back that would execute a dns flush,iprelease,iprenew(resetting your modem). this script worked great for awhile, then i found smac 2.7 and i can change ip's in about 10 seconds, it far surpasses the written script. every time i change accounts i simply run ccleaner,then run smac 2.7, and i have mozilla setup to clear all my flash cookies every time i exit out of it. something you might check out, saves you the router cost and the pain in setting them up. good luck you may not post new threads you may not post replies you may not stop the guessing games and learn how you can quickly and easily get back

T	review: bored of 'lord of the dance' | detnews.com | the detroit news
C	 review: bored of 'lord of the dance' tom long / detroit news film critic happy st. patrick's day. don't go see "lord of the dance in 3d." first off, the 3-d is terrible, absolutely the worst. somehow it actually manages to make the production look one-dimensional, especially when the camera pulls back to capture the full width of the stage. advertisement beyond that the entire proceedings are dark and fuzzy. in truth, the only time you notice the "3-d" is when occasional cheesy animated designs shoot out. the rest of the time it just looks like a really poorly made film. there's one other major problem, though. the dancing is so repetitious, it's headache inducing. realize this opinion comes from a guy who's so full-blooded irish he bears a shamrock tattooed on one arm and a celtic braid done in dublin on the other. but after watching star michael flatley dance the same essential steps for an hour, my reaction was: really? that's all we've got? centuries of culture and all we've come up with is some tap-dance-jig stuff? true, there's a story of sorts going on here. some of the tap-dancing-jig folks are dressed in gestapo black, others are in white. the gestapo guys break the flute of some fairy dancer. then the white-dressed mr. flatley comes out and does tap-jig battle with the main gestapo guy, and guess what? good triumphs over evil. again: really? that's all we've got? all the repetitious dancing is accompanied by rock concert-type lighting and there's an elaborate stage set. this is probably quite stunning live. in awful 3-d it's not. every once in a while a couple of hot blonde female types break things up by having an electric violin fiddle-off. but then the fiddle-offs become repetitious as well. obviously there are many fans of this stuff, "lord of the dance" having played approximately two billion sold-out shows. but even fans are going to find the 3-d hard to fathom. meanwhile, non-fans are sure to be asking, when is that guy going to stop slamming his feet on the floor? and: where's the guinness?

T	path of radiation leak at japan plant unclear | the associated press | news | san francisco examiner
C	 in this saturday, april 2, 2011 photo released by tokyo electric power co. (tepco) via kyodo news, leaking radioactive contaminated water drain through crack of a maintenance pit, right, into the sea, near the unit 2 reactor of fukushima dai-ichi nuclear nuclear power plant in okumamachi, fukushima prefecture, northeastern japan. highly radioactive water was leaking into the sea saturday from a crack discovered at the nuclear power plant destabilized by last month's earthquake and tsunami, a n workers used a milky white dye monday as they frantically tried to trace the path of highly radioactive water that is gushing from a tsunami-damaged japanese nuclear plant and leaking into the ocean. a crack in a maintenance pit was found over the weekend - the latest confirmation that radioactivity continues to spill into the environment. the leak is a symptom of the primary difficulty at the fukushima dai-ichi complex: radioactive water is pooling around the plant and preventing workers from powering up cooling systems that would stabilize overheating reactors. government officials conceded sunday that it will likely be several months before the cooling systems are completely restored. and even after that happens, there will be years of work ahead to clean up the area around the complex and figure out what to do with it. until all the pools of contaminated water are pumped to storage tanks and the cooling system restored, the makeshift methods of pumping water into the reactors and allowing it to gush out wherever it can are the only way to bring down temperatures and pressure in the reactor cores, where fuel rods continue to produce massive amounts of heat even though nuclear reactions have stopped. "we must keep putting water into the reactors to cool to prevent further fuel damage, even though we know that there is a side effect, which is the leakage," hidehiko nishiyama, a spokesman for the nuclear safety and industrial agency, said. "we want to get rid of the stagnant water and decontaminate the place so that we can return to our primary task to restore the sustainable cooling capacity as quickly as possible." that makeshift system also complicates plant operator tokyo electric power co.'s other goal: containing the spread of radiation. radioactivity has spewed from the plant since march 11, when a 9.0-magnitude earthquake spawned a massive tsunami that decimated large swaths of japan's northeastern coast. up to 25,000 people are believed to have died in the disaster, and tens of thousands lost their homes. thousands more were forced to flee a 12-mile (20-kilometer) radius around the plant because of the radiation. over the weekend, an 8-inch-long (20-centimeter-long) crack was discovered in a maintenance pit, sending a stream of water into the sea. the area is normally blocked off by a seawall, but a crack was also discovered in that outer barrier monday. while radioactivity is quickly diluted in the ocean, a government spokesman said monday that the sheer volume of contamination is becoming a concern. it is not clear how much water has leaked from the pit so far. "even if they say the contamination will be diluted in the ocean, the longer this continues, the more radioactive particles will be released and the greater the impact on the ocean," said chief cabinet secretary yukio edano. "we are strongly urging tepco that they have to take immediate action to deal with this." the operator said monday it is ordering fencing that is typically used to contain oil spills. the screens are not designed to trap radioactivity but might curtail the flow of water and thus reduce the spread of contamination, said tepco manager teruaki kobayashi. it was not clear when they would arrive. in the meantime, the company has tried to seal the leak with concrete and then by injecting a mixture of polymer, sawdust and shredded newspaper farther up a system of trenches, closer to where they believed the source was. the failure of these efforts appeared to signal that officials were targeting the wrong channel to the maintenance pit. then, workers threw several pounds (kilograms) of milky white bath salts into the system, to see if they could trace the water's path. the dye has yet to hit the ocean. "there could be other possible passages that the water may be traveling. we must watch carefully and contain it as quickly as possible," nishiyama said. before restoring the cooling system, workers must rid the plant of the pools of radioactive water that have collected under each of the three troubled reactors' turbine buildings and have spilled into various trenches around the complex. tepco has proposed pumping it into tankers, barges and is now considering sending it to a storage facility on site. work on those problems continue to make progress, even as workers try to stop the latest leak, nishiyama said. "we have to apply stopgap measures to day-to-day problems, like the pit water leakage, but we are continuing on our effort to achieve the goal," he said. reader comments all comments on this page are subject to our terms of use and do not necessarily reflect the views of the examiner or its staff. reader-submitted content that advocates violence or racism, is libelous, or is in all caps is not permitted. repeatedly pasting the same text into multiple comments (for any reason) will be treated as unsolicited advertising and will result in removal of your posting privileges. the examiner has recently changed our comments system and restored the disqus commenting platform we were formerly using. please click here for more information on this change. plane crashes into water near oakland international airport, killing pilot 'wild' documentary showing at the 4 star theatre in the richmond

T	loose laces: happy birthday, jola!
C	 happy birthday, jola! -- barack obama-as i understand the scenario-was elected to the office of u.s. president on his platform of real change. so far the only major changes i can see are his backing down on his campaign promises by giving in to weak-kneed wimps in his own party and the lies and whines of the republican party which has swung so far to the right that it would surely shock our founding fathers. will someone who cares more for this nation than he or she covets his own political ass please attempt to run for the office. mr. obama is becoming more of an embarrassment to america each time he opens his mouth. that sounds much like george w. bush in the raw. -- yesterday i found an online recipe for carolyn which called for cut-up pea pods. it took a few minutes of patient explaining to make her understand that peas grow inside living, green pods much the same as beans; i ultimately googled a pic for her. she was raised a city girl; at least she knows how to cook veggies to perfection. -- may your wednesday worts be wonderful. ----

T	i hate you sean penn
C	 fancy meeting you here sean penn already wants to get married. fuck. from the national enquirer : scarlett johansson's mega-entrancin' 24-years-older sean penn, reassuring pals who worry he's getting too serious too fast that she's "not rushing into anything" after her painful breakup with hubby ryan reynolds - but scarjo confesses she loves sitting at the feet of (so to speak) the?er, aged sage! "scarlett says every day with sean is an education equivalent to a college course - he's so worldly and knowledgeable," reports a friend. "she knows she married ryan way too fast, but insists she's a quick learner. even though marriage seems to be on sean's mind and he's pushing things a little fast, scarlett's doing her best to hold him off at the pass." every day is an education with sean? what the hell could scarlett possibly be learning from that commie bastard? the only subjects that guy is qualified to teach are "how to hate your country 101," "sympathizing with america's enemies parts 1 and 2," and "an introductory guide on how to stop growing at age 12." besides, what does scarlett need with an education? she has huge tits. *5 scarlett johansson pictures total in the gallery:

T	cancer treatment to be interrupted for hysterectomy.....
C	 it seems that my plan was set for carbo and abraxane in doses three times stronger than i was on during radiation and adding avastin. this was to be given every three weeks for two to three cycles, followed by pet scan to see how we did with initial treatment. if all was well my onc was going to do alimta until mid september. it as been known to them that i have two large uterine fibroids and despite chemo and continuous birth control pills (skipping the placebo week) i have ad some form of menstral activity daily since january 2. my hemoglobin has always been high and even with chemo as stayed at 10. my oncologist is concerned and feels that somewhere in here we have to fit in a hysterectomy. i am not opposed, would love for that problem to go away, but my gyn has no idea how to manage this, nor does my onc. i hear a lot of guessing in each of their offices. wondering if anyone here has had a similar case. need help. my dance card is just too full! was supposed to quiet down after radiation!

T	crazy on tap - apple bans drunk-driving apps
C	(?) choosy moms know better than to feed their kids hydrogenated vegetable oil laced with peanuts and salt, i hope. seriously, those things turn me into a prepubescent little girl. my tank is full of zoanthids! and my hovercraft is full of eels! kudos to apple. google should most certainly do the same in the android market. ), though, the part i don't like about apple's decision is that while they are removing from their curated, apple-backed market, that leaves users with no other choice. probably because they're rolling out their own. i don't think apps that allow you to avoid dui checkpoints are "drunk driving" apps. i consider them 4th amendment preservation apps. those checkpoints are illegal. oh, is that what it is? i thought it was a way for your iphone to tell you that you were drunk and shouldn't drive. ++i consider them 4th amendment preservation apps. those checkpoints are illegal. i resent the idea that corporations are acting like censors altogether though. that's the beginning of a very bad road. oh, sure muppet, you say that now. just wait until some drunk driver drives into your front porch some day. then you'll demand action. well, i'm sure he'd demand admonishment of the offender and reparation from him. he probably wouldn't demand sodomization of civil liberty. but that's what we do here when people piss us off. we form a posse and start a war. "start a war"? no we don't. we only do that when they blow-down our buildings. #oh, sure muppet, you say that now. just wait until some drunk driver drives into your front porch some day. then you'll demand action. hahaha. bullshit. someone driving into my front porch will piss me off. the fact that he may have been drinking is incidental. the figures for "alcohol related traffic accidents" get very interesting when you look into the definition of "alcohol related". using self as the data point, i have driven both sober and dui. i have been sober in every single one of the traffic accidents that i have been involved in in about 30 years of driving, including the one (yes, 1) where i was at fault. i do not drive now when i have had a drink, not because i am afraid of crashing, but because i don't want to deal with the hassle of going to court. i short, i am afraid of the cops. ymmv not literal hubble. war on drugs. war on drunk driving. war on racism. war on uhm... picking on gay people. we form an "army" and attack. there's armies for almost every cause. ohh, so not a literal "war", just a slogan and some money spent. fair enough. pigpen, are you arguing that alcohol is not an impairment? perhaps it's a confirmation bias, but it's astonishing how accident after accident has a dui charge levied. these are serious accidents, and not the "derp i turned without an advance and some guy crushed my bumper" type. unless about 90% of drivers are driving drunk, impaired drivers make up a grotesquely disproportionate percentage of people getting in serious accidents. that point is really long past being argued. as an aside, since dui laws and checkpoints have been put in place alcohol related vehicular deaths have dropped from 60% of all deaths in 1982, to "just" 37% in 2008. looks like it's working. if you believe that driving drunk is inconsequential you should be put down. i just think the checkpoints are immoral and illegal. "i consider them 4th amendment preservation apps." exactly. i've never driven under the influence, and yet i have a strong desire to avoid random checkpoints since it makes me have flashbacks to my previous life in a nazi concentration camp. government sets these up to seize power. the drunk thing is a pretense. as raul emmanuel said, "never let a good tragedy go to waste." he said that in the context that any time people are killed, the government should use it as a pretext to seize new powers. geez, you guys are sure paranoid. last few times i went through these so-called "checkpoints", the cops took one look at me and waved me through. on the other hand, the water-boarding redefinition of "torture", and the illegal wire-tapping, now those are real threats to our civil liberties. but you keep focussed on apple apps and anti-drunk-driving initiatives. ooh, look, shiny! the fact is that you are being stopped on the street without cause by enforcement agents. the facts of that stop from start to finish don't matter. "without cause"? they think you could be drunk, that's "cause" surely? shoot, i got pulled over because my brake-light had burned out, that's sufficient "cause". i'm not talking about traffic stops. i'm talking about checkpoints. i've used the word "checkpoint" 4 times in this thread. stop talking. "they think you could be drunk, that's "cause" surely?" using this theory, you might have illegal drugs in your house, so it's ok to enter it without a warrant and take a look around. "geez, you guys are sure paranoid. last few times i went through these so-called "checkpoints", the cops took one look at me and waved me through." wow, a middle aged, middle class white man got "waved through". what a surprise. perhaps you should try "driving while black" in the major cities, or "driving while hispanic" in the southwest. or "driving while poor" anywhere. #are you arguing that alcohol is not an impairment? not at all. there are many impairments. alcohol is one that everyone gets hysterical about though. i wonder if they'll ban speed camera (including mobile camera) apps. surely they should based on the same principle and consistency? regardless of the fact that the uk police forces publish their locations online, and that sat nav's, and online routing services (e.g. the aa, britain's largest vehicle owener association) routinely provide this information. i remember being in the uk at one time when there was some doodah about speed cameras, and how the police were using them to generate revenues. i think it was in that discussion that the police were forced to publish them. the argument goes something like this. a. cameras are there to slow traffic down, and prevent accidents, *not* to make money for the govt. b. evidence shows that people slow down when they know that there is a camera c. ergo tell people where the cameras are, including a big reflective see-it-from-a-mile-away box for the camera. d. not doing so would have confirmed that the cameras were not there to slow traffic, but to trap motorists and make money for the govt. iirc a large proportion of the cameras were not even operational, but the presence of those big yellow boxes did slow traffic ... that is of course till people figured out which cameras were real, and which ones were just for show. while i don't doubt that some jurisdictions do use them for revenue generation, i do not understand the "if they want it to do {x}, they should publish its location/times/etc". the purpose of enforcement is to give you the sense that they are everywhere. it isn't enough that you slowdown or stop yourself from running a red light because you see a big warning that it's there, but instead that you always worry about its presence. ##the purpose of enforcement is to give you the sense that they are everywhere. even where the evidence is that people slow down when they *know* a camera is present and not when they think there *might* be a police trap? the latter then allows you to place the cameras in black spots where the risk of an accident at high speed (blind curves?) is particularly high. one attitude fixes the problem df, while the other one merely uses the ineffective "be good always for ye know not when the master of the house is returning" method. #the latter then allows grrrr, should have been "the former then allows" #the latter then allows grrrr, should have been "the former then allows" ... is it ineffective? most people don't speed (beyond the "everyone knows you can go {x} over without being bothered" amount) because they don't want a radar trap to get them. i'd say it's very effective. there was a desire to devote less police hours to surprise enforcement, and to take advantage of technology, however strangely people demand that they know where and when they might get caught for breaking the law. the big question becomes "do you want people to slow down because you say so goddammmit!", or "do you want to reduce the number and severity of road accidents"? cell phones are more of an impairment than being flat assed drunk. every study that has compared the two has found cell phones more dangerous. obviously no one here has ever talked or texted while driving. since if you have, you have no leg to stand on to criticize drunk drivers, who are safer drivers than you. i think cameras are effectively 4th amendment violators too. what's the difference in those and a cop? i dunno, but i'm sure there is one and it is important.

C	 this assignment was my absolute favorite! engaging with the material in the studio, working with new and exciting faces, helping others, learning multi creative ideas, and taking charge/action with the models will all help me in becoming a better photographer. this studio was breathtaking. it was the first time i worked on a set that large. the models were so cooperative in taking direction as well as putting on layers of makeup and changing outfits every half hour. this assignment lead me to explore my creative mind in new and fashionable ways. it will help me to apply these ideas while shooting everyday, in and outside the studio!

T	tsa watch: could you please define ?accountability??
C	 accountability. that was the dramatic headline on tsa's blog late yesterday announcing the firing of at least 30 employees, including two senior managers, at honolulu international airport, for "improperly" screening baggage. actually, the luggage wasn't screened at all. not that it really mattered. no planes exploded mid-air, thanks to their negligence. it's nice of the tsa to be talking about accountability. but there is much to still be accountable for. agents pat down mentally disabled man how about this one? the mandy family was flying from detroit to orlando when two tsa agents singled drew mandy out for a special pat-down. although drew is 29, he has the mental capacity of a two-year-old. they confiscated a toy and stopped his father from trying to explain that his son posed no threat to the security of the flight. many of you thought the tsa should be held accountable at high level for allowing a humiliating pat-down to be performed on a passenger with virtually no security risk. have no id, will not fly what about phil mocek, the seattle software developer who who was arrested in 2009 in for trying to fly out of albuquerque. his crime? flying without an id. he faced several misdemeanor charges, all of which were dropped after recordings proved he was on his best behavior. but how about some accountability? mocek is reportedly suing the city of albuquerque, their aviation police and the tsa for civil rights violations. the full monte and then there's lynsie murley, the 24-year-old woman flying out of corpus christi airport in may 2008. she was selected for an enhanced pat-down, and an agent pulled her "blouse completely down, exposing plaintiff's breasts to everyone in the area," according to one report. then the agents joked about the incident, promising to watch it again on video. tsa settled with her for $2,350, but no one at the agency was warned, reprimanded or fired in the incident. the best she could have hoped for, besides the settlement, was an impersonal apology. "we regret that the passenger had an unpleasant experience," an agency representative said. that's accountability? come on. he checked your bags and swiped your laptop a former tsa agent in orlando is accused of stealing $5,000 worth of electronics from travelers' luggage while working at orlando international airport. elliot iglesias was stationed in front of the us airways ticket counter and authorities allege he stole four laptops and a wireless modem from luggage. a co-worker reportedly caught him in the act, leading to his termination. although iglesias faces up to a decade in jail, i'm doubtful he'll spend even half that amount of time behind bars. all of these incidents raise essentially the same question: when it comes to the tsa, what is accountability? is it a word the agency is allowed to use when it's convenient, but can otherwise ignore because it's above the law? or is it a core value, and is the honolulu incident a turning point that signals a new era in real accountability for federal screeners? oh, who am i kidding?

"this is a comprehensive rezoning plan for clarksville-montgomery county, and it is the result of one entire year's work. this is not for next school year," emphasized schools director mike harris. "in developing this plan, we tried to avoid mistakes in rezoning that other school districts across the state have made. harris said cmcss plans to phase in the plan to minimize its disruptiveness for families. "we tried to avoid rushing it, or putting it together too fast and implementing it too fast," he said. "that's why we're slow-walking it, and there will be a lot of public input included." a guiding principle of the process, officials said, is avoiding having to build new schools to accommodate continued growth until the clarksville-montgomery county school system is satisfied that all existing school infrastructure is being used efficiently. the growth is indisputable. since 1986, cmcss has grown by some 16,000 students, or a net of about 600 new students per year. cmcss chief operations officer jim sumrell, who made the presentation on rezoning tuesday evening, said cmcss gathered a vast amount of detailed analytical data to support its recommendations. considerations range from building capacity rates in all of the schools, student enrollment data and trends, projected residential growth throughout the county, special education needs, socioeconomics and transportation issues. six study outcomes were identified through the lengthy process, including: considering or identifying future campus developments or purchases, cleaning up existing zone lines in a way that they make sense and don't leave students at one school living in an area that is unnecessarily surrounded by households representing another school; and improving school building utilizations. under the plan, 331 students currently attending rossview high school will be transferred to kenwood high school, while 268 from rossview middle will go to kenwood middle. elsewhere, 160 students from west creek high school are being transferred to northeast high school, while 126 from west creek middle go to northeast middle. another 98 students from kenwood high will go to west creek high, and 84 from kenwood middle to west creek middle. from kenwood high, 105 students will transfer to northwest high, and 85 from kenwood middle go to new providence middle. finally, 148 clarksville high students will transfer to rossview high, and 140 from richview middle go to rossview middle. "this plan cleans up the zone lines using natural and mad-made geographical boundaries, and creates a nice balance in building capacity in all the schools, and the ability to grow over the next several years," sumrell said. also as part of the rezoning plan, the opening of the new carmel elementary school in southeast montgomery county means 574 students from sango elementary will go to the new school. another 35 students from east montgomery elementary go to carmel, and 92 students from emes are being rezoned to sango elementary. from barksdale elementary, 104 students will be rezoned to sango. maps and feedback forms are being posted in effected schools this week. on sept. 6, the school board will hold a public hearing on zoning, and the following day, the staff's final zoning recommendation will be prepared based on stakeholder feedback. on sept. 13, the staff's final zoning recommendation goes to the school board for second reading and beyond then, notification letters will be mailed to affected families. there will be no zone changes enacted in the 2011-12 school year. however, in 2012-13, and along with the opening of carmel elementary, all rezoned elementary and middle school students, freshmen and sophomores begin attending schools in their new school zones. juniors and seniors can enroll at their current or newly rezoned high schools that year, but cmcss transportation will only be provided to the new zones. columbia state community college to expand williamson county campus

T	awol soldier condemned '09 fort hood shootings - yahoo! news
C	10 mins ago killeen, texas - as pfc. naser abdo beseeched officials to grant him conscientious objector status and release him from the military, he condemned a fellow muslim soldier accused of shooting 13 people to death at fort hood. such acts, he wrote, "run counter to what i believe in as a muslim." less than a year later, officials say abdo has admitted planning to launch another attack on fort hood with a bomb in a backpack and weapons stashed in a motel room where he was arrested wednesday, about 3 miles from the texas army base's main gate. the 21-year-old's writings, including the essay obtained by the associated press in which he deplored the 2009 shootings, portray a devout infantry soldier struggling with his faith while facing the prospect of deployment and what he felt was the scorn of his peers. "overall, as a muslim i feel that i will not be able to carry out my military duties due to my conscientious objection," abdo wrote in his application for the status. "therefore, unless i separate myself from the military, i would potentially be putting the soldiers i work with in jeopardy. "in this instance, i would be failing in my duty to my unit, my army and my god." abdo was approved as a conscientious objector this year, but his discharge was put on hold amid military charges that 34 images of child pornography were found on a computer he used. he went absent without leave from fort campbell, ky., during the july 4 weekend. on july 3, abdo tried to buy a gun at a store near the kentucky post, according to the company that owns the store. abdo told an ap reporter a week later that he was concerned about his safety and had considered purchasing a gun for protection, but had not yet done so. police in killeen said their break in the case came tuesday from guns galore llc - the same gun store where maj. nidal hasan bought a pistol used in the 2009 attack. store clerk greg ebert said abdo arrived by taxi and bought 6 pounds of smokeless gunpowder, three boxes of shotgun ammunition and a magazine for a semi-automatic pistol. ebert said he called authorities because he and his co-workers "felt uncomfortable with his overall demeanor and the fact he didn't know what the hell he was buying." "we would probably be here today, giving you a different briefing, had he not been stopped," said killeen police chief dennis baldwin, who called the plan "a terror plot." according to an army alert sent via email and obtained by the ap, killeen police learned from the taxi company that abdo had been picked up from a local motel and also had visited an army surplus store where he paid cash for a uniform bearing fort hood unit patches. agents found firearms and "items that could be identified as bomb-making components, including gunpowder," in abdo's motel room, fbi spokesman erik vasys said. the fbi planned to charge abdo with possessing bomb-making materials. an oklahoma lawyer who has represented abdo said thursday he hadn't heard him in weeks. "i've been quite anxious to get in touch with him," said attorney james branum. the army alert said abdo "was in possession of a large quantity of ammunition, weapons and a bomb inside a backpack," and upon questioning admitted planning an attack on fort hood. the military's criminal investigation division, along with the federal joint terrorism task force, had previously investigated abdo after he was flagged for making unspecified anti-american comments while taking a language class, according to a u.s. official briefed on the investigation. the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, said neither the military nor the task force discovered anything at the time to indicate abdo was planning an attack, the official said. as the first anniversary of the 2009 fort hood rampage approached, abdo sent to the ap the essay describing how he became a "different muslim" after going through basic training at fort benning, ga., and enduring religious harassment. "often times, during basic training the trainees would insult islam and insult muslims," he wrote. as a result, abdo said he grew reclusive and stopped socializing. abdo grew up in garland, a dallas suburb about 170 miles from fort hood. in his essay, he said his mother is christian and his father is muslim, and that he decided to follow islam when he was 17. "little did i know that when i first became a muslim that i was going to learn what islam meant to me and what i was willing to sacrifice for it," he wrote. abdo said life was better after he arrived at his first duty station, but that he studied islam more closely as he neared deployment to learn "whether going to war was the right thing to do islamically." "i began to understand and believe that only god can give legitimacy to war and not humankind," he wrote. "that's when i realized my conscience would not allow me to deploy." his application was filed in june 2010. abdo wrote that if it was granted, he looked forward to "rejoining the muslim community in dallas and spending some time on `the path of allah." he said he would devote days or weeks travelling to other states and sleeping in mosques to "revive the faith of the muslim nation." the army's conscientious objector review board denied his request, but the deputy assistant secretary of the army review boards agency recommended this year he be separated from the army as a conscientious objector. the discharge was delayed when he was charged with possession of child pornography on may 13. fort campbell civilian spokesman bob jenkins said abdo had been aware of the child pornography investigation since november. abdo attempted to purchase a gun july 3 from quantico tactical, a store near fort campbell in oak grove, ky., said david hensley, president of the seven-store chain. hensley said abdo went into the store twice that day. the first time, after asking questions, he left. the second time, he attempted to buy a handgun, hensley said. "he exhibited behavior that alerted our staff and our staff refused to, based upon that behavior, sell him a firearm," he said. the ap was among the media outlets to interview abdo in the past year when reporting on his request for objector status. on july 12, abdo contacted an ap reporter with whom he had spoken previously, said he had gone awol and considered purchasing a gun for personal protection. abdo said he had not yet done so, because he knew he would have to give his name and other information to the gun dealer. the ap described the contents of this conversation on july 14 to a civilian army spokesman. the next day, when contacted by army investigators, the ap said it did not know abdo's location and provided the telephone number from which he made his original call. u.s. video: republicans postpone vote on debt bill u.s. video: police hunt for shooter in robbery spree time.com: it just doesn't work: why new tech products are increasingly unsatisfying abc news: delaware man executed for woman's 1992 ax slaying man cheats credit score he added 126 points to his credit score using this 1 easy tip the new skinny fruit how this strange african fruit is making america skinny. upgrade your lifesometimes it's best to stick with last year's model.

"late last night it became apparent that our meagan was no longer with us," the family wrote in an online journal . "the decision was made to allow to her to be at peace." the school district where toothman graduated from and worked released a statement saying, "meagan was a gift and will be deeply missed." "everyone's praying for them, but it does help put things into perspective and make you realize whats important in life, so everyone's praying for them," said terri nunnari, a parent in the district. "it's really sad," said student natalie gold. "i guess it's bringing everyone together a little more. they just make us more aware of how much we need each other." those who died and more than 40 people who were injured were crushed beneath the rigging that came crashing down as a severe thunderstorm bore down on the indiana state fairgrounds just before 9 p.m. on aug. 13, moments before country music duo sugarland was set to hit the stage for a concert. jenny haskell, 22, a senior at ball state university, died six days after the collapse. tammy vandam, 42, of wanatah; alina bigjohny, 23, of fort wayne; glenn goodrich, 49, of indianapolis; christina santiago, 29, of chicago; and nathan byrd, 51, of indianapolis, were also killed in the stage collapse. indiana state police stopped releasing information about people who are still hospitalized, citing medical privacy regulations, but it is believed that at least a dozen people are still hospitalized, some with critical injuries. investigators are poring over policy, procedure and physical aspects of the stage collapse. winds of up to 70 mph were estimated at the time of the collapse, and a severe thunderstorm warning had been issued for marion county about 10 minutes prior to the collapse. watch 6news and refresh this page for updates. a fund to help the victims and their families has been established by the central indiana community foundation. donations can be made theindychannel.com all rights reserved. this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. the following are comments from our users. opinions expressed are neither created nor endorsed by theindychannel.com. by posting a comment you agree to accept our irene strengthens as it spins toward bahamas, us us, nato worry about libya's weapons stockpile 'sex and the city' star: there is a third movie

C	 30 day photo challenge, day 18: in my bag. since i telecommute, my messenger bag has been pretty much empty for the past 6 years, so i had to scramble around to find anything in a bag. i also considered for a minute or so to put nikki in one of those reusable shopping bags (the ones with the handles) but then i realized that she would maul me if i even tried to disrupt her sunbathing. so pj's jelly bean stash it is. the challenge is at -for-challenge.html

"it's bad luck it happened here and not in the locker room," he said. but because it did, that was the big news sunday at the u.s. open - bigger than nadal's straight-set win over david nalbandian that ended about two hours before the cramping episode, bigger than wins by americans donald young (a surprise) and andy roddick (not as much of one). "i just have cramping in my leg, that's all," nadal said. his 7-6 (7-5), 6-1, 7-5 win over nalbandian was routine, at least as routine as they've been going for the defending champion and no. 2 seed through the first week at flushing meadows. he gave up a break early in the first set but fought back to force a tiebreaker that he won. he gave back a break in the third set to turn a possible 6-3 close-out into something much closer. he is winning but not steamrolling - serving well, but not dominating the way he did last year. last year, he lost serve five times in seven matches; this year, he's lost nine service games in three. "i was happy about almost everything today," nadal said. "i think my movements worked pretty well, and the forehand worked really well, and the backhand, too. just when i had to win the match at 5-3, i played a really bad game there. for the rest of the match, i happy about everything." but shortly after saying that, the cramping came - in his right quadriceps and his right hamstring. a scary scene with a few dozen reporters looking on and the cameras rolling. certainly something that will give people plenty to talk about as nadal gears up for the second week, even if it wasn't a big deal. "not to put a dampener on the story, which i know you guys think is really big, but people cramp after matches when you're cold," roddick said after his match. "it's just something that happens. it's just unfortunate it happened in front of you all. every single player in there has had that happen before. every single one." indeed, there were other players struggling with the heat on a windy, humid day in queens with temperatures in the mid-80s. in louis armstrong stadium, no. 26 flavia pennetta backed up her victory over maria sharapova with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-6) win over no. 13 peng shuai of china. but she also struggled with the heat. trailing 5-3 in the second, pennetta got a break to stay in it. she forced a tiebreaker but appeared near exhaustion as the set wore on. roddick, seeded 21st, defeated julien benneteau 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) - a relatively easy match except for a third set that dragged out to 65 minutes. roddick is working his way into tournament shape after an injury-filled season. his next match is against no. 5 david ferrer, who beat 26th-seeded florian mayer of germany 6-1, 6-2, 7-6 (7-2). "a lot of what i do feeds into what he does well also," roddick said of the fellow baseliner. "i don't think there's a lot of secrets between us. most of the time we played, whoever has executed better has won." young, the one-time top-ranked junior in the world, took another step toward fulfilling his vast potential with a 7-5, 6-4, 6-3 upset over no. 24 juan ignacio chela on the grandstand court. the c-j's sunday college basketball notebook | hulls says hoosiers can turn it around u.s. open | rafael nadal\'s all cramped up even if it turns out to be nothing, which rafael nadal insists was the case, the frightening scene in his postmatch interview sunday will go down as memorable. answering questions in spanish, nadal investigations with impact: the heart of the courier-journal mission is public service journalism. daily, we print and put online the watchdog stories that significantly affect you.

T	where do the stimulus horror stories end? | examiner editorial | editorials | washington examiner
C	 president obama gave electric car maker fisker automotive a $529 million loan guarantee to build cars in the u.s. - but most of the jobs have gone to finland. among the most frequently heard criticisms from democrats of president george w. bush and the pre-2006 republican majorities in the house and senate was that corporations were being coddled even as they were sending american jobs overseas. then president obama proposed his $787 billion economic stimulus program and promised that it would bring unemployment down to 8 percent or less while saving or creating up to 3. 5 million jobs. it's nearly three years later, the official unemployment rate is still above 9 percent (and could be double that when those who quit looking for work or are underemployed are counted), and the media is increasingly full of headlines on stories about hundreds of millions of tax dollars being wasted in stimulus program scandals, most notably the $537 million solyndra bankruptcy. two more such scandals appeared this week, but these latest outrages feature a new wrinkle -- stimulus funds being used to create jobs overseas. in the first example, the obama administration handed $7.2 million to four oregon logging companies to hire loggers in a severely depressed industry. but according to a department of labor inspector general report, only two of jobs thus funded went to u.s. citizens: "only two oregonians were listed on the employer recruitment reports, indicating that workers in oregon were likely unaware these job opportunities were available. in fact, although 146 u.s. workers were contacted by the three employers regarding possible employment, none were hired. instead, 254 foreign workers were brought into the country for these jobs." in the second new stimulus program scandal this week, the obama administration gave electric car maker fisker automotive a $529 million loan guarantee to build vehicles in the united states. at the time, vice president biden claimed "this is seed money that will return back to the american consumer in billions and billions and billions of dollars in good new jobs." but the rest of the story came out this week when fisker officials acknowledged that most of the 500 jobs being created are actually in finland. allegedly they couldn't find a suitable assembly facility here in the united states, despite the fact detroit is the birthplace of the automotive industry, virtually every major manufacturer from around the world has put factories in this country, and there are thousands of unemployed auto workers here. obama administration officials approved the transfer of jobs to finland. all comments on this page are subject to our terms of use . the following are not allowed: all caps

C	 evening mate, i hear doc is getting a bit of stick for copying your posts! serves him right really. evening mate, have been tied up abit lately so not so many posts but been keeping a close eye on things,was some very interesting trades here today including one of 450k @ 4.25p and another of 227k @ 4.39p which followed on from that large buy yesterday at full ask of 4.75p , these had no effect on the shareprice and i believe these trades are not ordinary trades but corporate....we may see some more tomorrow ! some concise info here on sacoils assets which i believe have been overlooked lately. the deal with total could ultimately be worth us$300 million to sacoil, which will receive us$61.5 million staged over the next five years, of which us$7.5 million has already been paid. it also leaves the company with a 12.5 per cent interest ( free carry ) in the licence. as important, the group receives a free carry on all the exploration work right up to the final investment decision phase - in other words the point at which it is decided whether block iii is commercially viable and bank debt financeable. in nigeria sacoil has stakes in licences opl 233 and 281, which have already seen oil discoveries and where there is obvious scope to add value by turning a contingent resource into reserves.,there does seem scope for a substantial increase in reserves at opl 233 with consultants tracs identifying more than 100 feet of net oil and given that this block lies adjacent to the 600 million barrels plus apoi field," green points out. "good seismic here together with this well data could allow a significant resource to be proved up by the end of 2012." two wells already exist on opl 281 as well as good seismic data, which points to one large field that may potentially contain close on 100 million barrels. all that could be confirmed by future appraisal drilling which looks set to begin in april or may 2013, the gecr analyst adds. in the drc sacoil owns a 3,177 kilometre licence area known simply block iii. it is in the albetine graben, the source of tullow oil's (lon:tlw) kingfisher and giraffe-buffalo discoveries over the border in uganda. "to date the real excitement in this region has been on the ugandan side of the border where discoveries have produced well flow rates anywhere from 350 to 13,000 barrels of oil a day," green says. datafeed and uk data supplied by netbuilder and interactive data. while london south east do their best to maintain the high quality of the information displayed on this site, we cannot be held responsible for any loss due to incorrect information found here. all information is provided free of charge, 'as-is', and you use it at your own risk! the contents of all 'chat' messages should not be construed as advice and represent the opinions of the authors, not those of london south east limited, or its affiliates.

T	they will say we are not here - nytimes.com
C	the filmmakers katherine fairfax wright and malika zouhali-worrall explore the motivations, sorrows and dreams of the slain ugandan gay rights activist david kato. these are fragments of david kato, glimpses of a ugandan activist and friend who - one year ago today - was brutally murdered. these moments offer a perspective on the inner world that david shared with us, a world teeming with passion and relentless determination, good humor and vivid daydreams. during our first days in kampala, a member of parliament told us, "there is no longer a debate in uganda as to whether homosexuality is right or not - it is not." from what we knew of the pending anti-homosexuality bill - which proposed death for h.i.v.-positive gay men and prison for anyone who failed to turn in a known homosexual - we were tempted to believe him. but david showed us a different reality. initially, he played something of a fixer, our main liaison with the l.g.b.t., or "kuchu" community. we soon realized, however, that the man known as the "grandfather of the kuchus" was one of the most outspoken and inspired activists in east africa. the more time we spent documenting his work, the more evident it became that, contrary to the m.p.'s claim, david and his fellow activists were, in fact, generating real debate in uganda. kampala's kuchus had begun to dismantle the country's discriminatory status quo, and were working tirelessly to change their fate and that of others across africa. today, as we revisit our memories of david, we remember his fortitude and remarkable legal achievements, boldly guided by his vision of establishing a ugandan gay village. but perhaps most of all we recall these words, spoken with more logic than defiance: "if we keep on hiding, they will say we are not here." katherine fairfax wright and malika zouhali-worrall are the directors of

T	school bus ads could help struggling districts - education news story - wrtv indianapolis
C	rejected polar bear in stable condition mark wahlberg apologizes for 9/11 remarks school bus ads could help struggling districts posted: 5:32 pm est january 19, 2012 updated: 5:41 pm est january 19, 2012 indianapolis -- faced with growing budget constraints, school districts and state lawmakers are considering a proposal that would allow advertisements on the sides of school buses. senate bill 226, authored by state sen. pat miller, r-indianapolis, would require the state school bus committee to adopt rules that allow paid advertisements on buses. miller's district includes franklin township, where the school district stopped providing busing, instead contracting with the nonprofit central indiana educational service center, which charges $475 per child. "any revenue stream we can generate, we're in favor of," said walter bourke, franklin township schools superintendent, during the appropriations committee hearing thursday morning. "they need some assistance to get over this hurdle," miller said. seven states already allow ads on school buses -- arizona, colorado, tennessee, texas, new jersey, new mexico and utah -- and kentucky is currently considering legislation. but some question whether the ads could be distracting to children and drivers, and if they'll send the right message. "can you put the beer guys on there, but not the pop guys?" asked state sen. karen tallian, d-portage. "i look at it as opening a huge can of worms." tallian also expressed concern about ads creating unnecessary litigation for school districts. but supporters emphasized that the bill would establish strict rules on the placement of the bus advertising, which could not obstruct the bus driver's vision, distract motorists from warning arms or obscure the number on the back of the bus. "i think it's probably a good idea," said bill riggs, superintendent of the mount vernon community school corporation in hancock county, which is considering eliminating bus transportation altogether due to budget woes. "when you see the metro buses around, there's ads on them, and people routinely see them, and apparently, they're effective, because people keep putting them on there." bourke said the advertisements wouldn't solve all the district's money problems, but he said they could be a good start. "i don't think it'd be anywhere close to funding a transportation program from such advertisements because we're not going generate millions of dollars in ads," he said. "but to help us offset some costs and to help us with our revenue, we're certainly in support of that." one franklin township parent told rtv6 that even if the ads only generate thousands of dollars, it will be worth it.

T	alexandrianews - virginia?s oyster harvests boom
C	subscribe today is tuesday, february 7, 2012 print governor bob mcdonnell announced today that virginia's oyster harvest has skyrocketed over the past decade, a boom fueled through the virginia marine resources commission's use of a rotational harvest system, sanctuaries and targeted shell plantings on public oyster grounds. over the past decade, the oyster harvest in virginia has increased ten-fold, from 23,000 bushels in 2001 to 236,000 bushels in 2011. in that time, the dockside value of the oyster harvest increased from $575,000 to $8.26 million. in fact, last year's oyster harvest in virginia was the largest since 1989. speaking about the growth in the harvest, the governor noted, "virginia oysters are not only delicious, they are also profitable. our oysters are hitting tables all across the nation and the world, on the half-shell, fried, steamed, roasted and in stew. whether they be stingrays, chincoteagues, lynnhavens, or any kind of virginia oyster, they are in demand. the incredible growth in our oyster harvests is bringing in new revenue to the state, and creating new jobs for our citizens. i applaud the actions of previous gubernatorial administrations which have helped virginia oysters to make such a vigorous comeback, and we are committed to furthering the growth of this local industry in the years ahead. and, i would also note, nothing goes better with a half-dozen virginia oysters on the half-shell than a glass of virginia viognier, the signature white wine of the commonwealth." "the strides made have been remarkable, and indications are this year's harvest may be the best we've seen in 25 years," said vmrc commissioner steven g. bowman. "it can get even better if we stay the course and continue to spend the funds necessary to maintain our current level of productivity." that harvest level remains a far cry from the 1960s, when annual harvests of more than 1 million were commonplace. that was before two diseases, dermo and msx, spread throughout the chesapeake bay. the diseases do not harm humans, but kill oysters when they reach market size, around three years of age. over the decades, vmrc tried numerous approaches to combat the affect of those diseases on the oyster harvest and oyster stocks, with little to no success. but a new management scheme enacted four years ago has shown some impressive results. some harvest areas have been put on rotational management plans. they work like this: harvest areas are opened on a staggered basis for one harvest season then closed for one or two years in order to give oysters a chance in those areas to grow to market size. individual harvest area openings are staggered on a two or three year rotational basis. this allows harvests in some areas while others remain closed so the oyster stocks can regenerate and be reopened later, in time to harvest the market-sized stocks before the diseases kill them. combined with annual pre-season stock surveys, permanent oyster sanctuaries to act as broodstock, mid-season monitoring with stock updates as necessary, and planting oyster shells on public oyster grounds with available state funds, this proactive oyster management regime is paying off. vmrc's dr. jim wesson estimates every $1 spent by the state to plant oyster shell yields $7 in economic benefits in the form of larger harvests, and increased jobs for oyster shuckers and oyster packing houses. over the past four years of rotational harvests, the harvest off public oyster grounds has almost tripled, from 36,000 bushels to 99,000 bushels last year. in that time, the total oyster harvest - including privately leased oyster grounds and oyster farming operations - has grown from 95,000 bushels in 2008 to 236,000 bushels in 2011. that's an increase in dockside value from $3.5 million to $8.26 million in just the past four years. the ripple effects through the economy from last year's harvest resulted in roughly $22 million in economic value, using a multiplier of 2.63 on a dockside value of $8.26 million, a formula established by virginia institute of marine science seafood industry economist dr. james kirkley.

(the following statement was released by the rating agency) feb 02 - -- chalco's operating performance was much worse than we expected due to low profitability, subdued aluminum prices, and high production costs, which have weakened its financial risk profile. -- but we still see a 'high likelihood' of extraordinary support from the government for the chinese aluminum producer, supporting a three-notch uplift in the rating. -- we are lowering chalco's stand-alone credit profile to 'bb' from 'bb+' and the foreign currency long-term corporate credit rating to 'bbb' from 'bbb+'. -- the negative outlook reflects our expectation that chalco's financial performance is likely to remain weak throughout 2012. standard & poor's ratings services said today that it lowered its foreign currency long-term corporate credit rating on china-based aluminum producer aluminum corp. of china ltd. (chalco) to 'bbb' from 'bbb+' after lowering the stand-alone credit profile to 'bb' from 'bb+'. the outlook on the corporate credit rating is negative. we also lowered our greater china credit scale rating on chalco to 'cna-/--' from 'cna+/--'. 'we downgraded chalco to reflect the company's worse-than-expected financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2011 and our view that aluminum prices are likely to remain subdued in 2012 due to uncertainty in the global economy,' said standard & poor's credit analyst lawrence lu. 'as chalco's production costs remain high, we see little likelihood that the company will be able to improve its cash flow coverage measures or reduce its high debt levels while its profitability remains low.' the rating on chalco continues to reflect our expectation that the company will receive extraordinary timely and sufficient support, in the event of financial distress, from the government of the people's republic of china (aa-/stable/a-1+; cnaaa/cna-1+). the government effectively controls 42% of chalco through the company's parent, aluminum corp. of china (chinalco; not rated) and chalco's own subsidiary. in accordance with our criteria for government-related entities, we have assessed that there is a 'high' likelihood that the government would extend extraordinary support to chalco. chalco's 'bb' stand-alone credit profile reflects our view that the company has a satisfactory business risk profile and aggressive financial risk profile. higher electricity costs and much lower aluminum prices resulted in an operating loss for chalco in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to its announcement on jan. 30, 2011. we had expected a similar financial performance to that in the third quarter. in our view, the company's margin will remain under pressure in 2012, based on current aluminum price trends. chalco has taken efforts to cut its high costs, but its low self-sufficiency in electricity is a continuing constraint. in addition, as a state-owned enterprise (soe), the company has social responsibilities; for example, it can't lay off surplus workers at many of its operating facilities, thereby increasing its operating leverage. we expect chalco's cash flow coverage to remain very weak for its rating category in 2012. for example, we estimate its ratio of funds from operations (ffo) to total adjusted debt may be as low as 5%-6%. chalco's debt level remains high compared with peers. its ratio of debt to capital was about 57% as of sept. 30, 2011. we don't expect any meaningful debt reduction in the coming year because the company still has large capital expansion plans. we project chalco will continue to generate sizable negative free operating cash flow in the next couple of years at least, even if profitability improves somewhat. management has stated its intention to improve chalco's capital structure through issuing up to chinese renminbi (rmb) 9 billion in common shares in the domestic market (the company has obtained all necessary regulatory approval in china). we see a low likelihood that such issuance will happen soon because the stock markets are volatile and the company's share price has declined sharply in the past year. 'the negative outlook on the rating reflects our expectation that chalco's financial risk profile is likely to remain very weak in the next 12 months as aluminum prices remain subdued and the demand growth for aluminum product slows in china,' said mr. lu. we may lower the rating if chalco's stand-alone credit profile deteriorates further. this could happen if aluminum prices do not rebound from the currently low level and there is no sign of improvement in end-market conditions, such that the company's ratio of ffo to total debt stays below 10% for a prolonged period of time. the rating upside potential is currently limited. however, we could consider revising the outlook to stable if the company improves its profitability by increasing operating efficiency, such that its stand-alone credit profile improves and stabilizes--for example, its ratio of ffo to total debt rises above 12%. related criteria and research -- standard & poor's standardizes liquidity descriptors for global corporate issuers, july 2, 2010 -- methodology and assumptions on risks in the mining industry, june 22, 2009 -- criteria methodology: business risk/financial risk matrix expanded, may 27, 2009 -- 2008 corporate criteria: ratios and adjustments, april 15, 2008 (bangalore ratings team, hotline: +91 80 4135 5898 swati.ray@thomsonreuters.com,group id:bangaloreratings@thomsonreuters.com,reuters messaging: swati.ray.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net) copyright copyright thomson reuters 2012. all rights reserved. you can select a currency and/or a topic to filter articles. search for a news provider, date, or keywords. ? 1995-2012 xe corporation. all rights reserved.

T	man-making: making mentoring safe
C	 a few months back, i reached a limit of sorts, when the news about jerry sandusky and the penn state tragedy appeared. in this tabloid "news" world we live in, we are always hearing about molesters and the layers of tragedy they create. i titled that blog post, " i'm really angry about creepy guys ," and i still am, a little. the truth is there are so many more wonderful stories about really good men showing up for young males with inspirational tales of lives transformed. but sadly, the dominant media focus always seems to be on the sordid. i know it's a good thing to shine the light of awareness in the dark places, but how about some balance? i'll be trying to bring some of that balance in future posts. if you have a story about good men or a man involved in boys' lives, please send it along to me . the world needs to hear these stories. the good news is that youth-serving organizations everywhere are learning how to do a better job of screening applicants. this creates more protection for young people and the organization. it makes parents more comfortable, and the right prospective volunteers feel safe in applying. when it's clear an organization is using state of the art background checking and other forms of vetting, volunteers know they, too, will be protected from guilt by association should something or someone go terribly wrong. one organization in the vanguard of this movement is friends for youth, inc. , out of redwood city, ca. they have been in the mentoring business for a quarter of a century and, out of that experience, they have produced an amazing book titled, safe (screening applicants for effectiveness): guidelines to prevent child molestation in mentoring and youth-serving organizations . it's the most current and comprehensive work on the subject i've seen in a while. it covers a literature review on the issue of child molestation, offers examples of and instruction in best-practice screening and monitoring of applicants, and describes state-of-the-art molestation prevention tools and resources. the safe book is a good read for anyone who wants to understand what it means to have solid organizational integrity when it comes to protecting kids and the good adults who want to support them. you can order the safe book on the friends for youth, inc. website. as an indication the commitment by friends for youth to helping organizations and protecting kids, they are offering a free webinar on this important topic. it's being offered on tuesday, feb. 28th, 2012, from 10:00 am to 11:15 am (pst). the webinar is open to anyone who cares enough to be interested. visit their website webinar page for more information and to register. in making involvement with young people safe, perhaps it will remove some of the fear of involvement that results in long organizational wait-lists of young guys. young males are hoping someone like you might come forward and hang out with them for a while, maybe be a man-maker in someone's life! like: if you enjoy this blog, please visit the man-making facebook page and click the "like" button. tweet: sent this post along to your friends or follow me on twitter! tweet follow @earlh subscribe: if you're not yet a subscriber to the man-making blog, and you'd like to receive these posts by email 3-4 times a month, go to this link for a free subscription . contact: send earl a message .

T	spiritual - wicca for beginners by moonwolf what is wicca - wattpad
C	 wicca is a religion. like all religions, wicca is a lifestyle, a relationship with the divine and a set of mores. practioners of... or adherants to... wicca are called wiccans. wicca is a contemporary spiritual religion, based on and reviving the ancient pre-christian pagan religions of europe. wiccans believe in a divine force or power as the source of all. it is both immanent and transcendent while encompassing the whole universe. therefore the world and all aspects within the world, "nature" and "life itself" in particular, are considered sacred. wiccans use ancient and modern ceremonies, rituals and shamanic practices to attune themselves to the natural rhythms of nature, the world, and the universe in their efforts to commune with this divine force. wicca has no high authority, no single leader, no prophet and no bible to dictate its laws and beliefs. every wiccan is as important as another and all share equal status. most wiccans are solitary practitioners known as "hedge witches" (see how wiccans practice wicca), but there are also many "covens". covens include groups of up to 13 people, which is equal to the 13 phases of the moon during the year. covens are normally presided over by a priest or priestess who has had years of practice in magick and ritual techniques. the priest or priestess is respected as an elder and teacher of the craft. while not exclusive to every single tradition, the following are some of the core tenets found in most wiccan systems: the divine is present in nature, and so nature should be honored and respected. everything from animals and plants to trees and rocks are elements of the sacred. you'll find that many practicing wiccans are passionate about the environment. the idea of karma and an afterlife is a valid one. what we do in this lifetime will be revisited upon us in the next. part of this idea of a cosmic payback system is echoed in the law of threefold return ( see laws of wicca). our ancestors should be spoken of with honor. because it's not considered out of the ordinary to commune with the spirit world, many wiccans feel that their ancestors are watching over them at all times. the divine has polarity -- both male and female. in most paths of wicca, both a god and goddess are honored(see gods and godesses) the divine is present in all of us. we are all sacred beings, and interaction with the gods is not limited just to the priesthood or a select group of individuals. holidays are based on the turning of the earth and the cycle of the seasons. in wicca, eight major sabbats are celebrated, as well as monthly esbats( see sabbats) everyone is responsible for their own actions. personal responsiblity is the key. whether magical or mundane, one must be willing to accept the consquences -- either good or bad -- of their behaviour. harm none, or something like it. while there are a few different interpretation of what actually constitutes harm, most wiccans follow the concept that no harm should intentionally be done to another individual.

T	inversion therapy table (jacque crook)
C	back pains are considered to be a common occurrence as people age, but that doesn't necessarily apply to all people - depending on the activities that these people do every day. many of these activities can be used as therapy for relieving the back pain. simple things like medication and exercising may work for many people. others may have to try all sorts of methods until they discover one that finally works. some historians claim that there is one type of back pain therapy that is highly effective. it has been around for centuries. it is referred to as inversion therapy. individuals that engage in this form of therapy today use a special therapy table to reap the highest benefits for their health. about inversion therapy inversion therapy is a process where you have to hang yourself upside down or any inverted angle to decompress the body joints. this idea may sound like it doesn't help at all when you think about it, but you have to know that the direction of the gravity does not reverse if your body is inverted. any pressure applied to the discs can affect the pressure towards the nerves leading to the pains. the gravity will provide relief to the nerve roots and discs resulting to the recovery of lost moisture. since hanging upside down can put your body at risk if done incorrectly, an inversion table is recommended so your body stays stable and comfortable. benefits of inversion therapy many people believe that inversion therapy is a good solution to back pains but actual owners of an inversion table have discovered other benefits. relieving the spine pains can actually improve your posture as well because the therapy table can be used to properly align the hips and spine. because the gravity can increase the spacing in the joints, the muscles that cross those joints end up being stretched far more than conventional stretching methods. these stretching methods can improve your body's flexibly. it is also important to stimulate the blood circulation within your body so that your brain receives more oxygen to improve your mental awareness. gravity can hamper the circulation as long as you are upright and an therapy table can help you take advantage of gravity instead by letting the blood circulate n parallel to the gravity. inversion therapy can also reduce stress which may seem hard to believe at first because hanging upside down doesn't sound very comfortable at all. the stress relieving component is more of a benefit of using an therapy table because you no longer need to fully hang upside down to get some relief. do not gamble, instead why not try online casino gambling sites using no deposit required codes

T	post-poll, allies join opposition in slamming upa govt - the times of india
C	 share and discuss tweet new delhi: providing a foretaste of a turbulent budget session, upa partners trinamool congress and national conference teamed up with non-upa parties like samajwadi party and janata dal (u) to slam congress over minority quotas and the national counter-terrorism centre during a pre-parliament meeting on wednesday. a routine meeting of chief whips saw some political exchanges with nc criticizing the home ministry's decision to convene a discussion of state police chiefs on nctc when the matter needed the intervention of cms. "police chiefs are officials, what can they say on this," said nc's sharifuddin shariq. he found the support of trinamool, which has spared no opportunity to take on congress. "the centre is always looking to intrude into the domain of the states," trinamool mp sukhendu roy said while the nc mp added that home minister p chidambaram needed a reality check. the abrasive language was noticed by other party representatives as a meeting of chief whips is hardly seen to be a forum for politics to play out. the discussions convened by parliamentary affairs minister pawan bansal was expected to be a fairly ordinary affair. the government seems to be gearing up for rough weather as well with the treasury benches focusing on the presentation of the railway and general budgets and the passage of the vote on account by end of march. the ruling coalition does not appear keen to put forward pending legislation or introduce fresh bills. nc also sought a discussion on congress's poll pledge of a 4.5% quota in the up election with its representative criticizing the ruling party for not acting on the sachar commission findings on the socio-economic status and failing to implement the recommendations of the rangnath mishra committee on religious and linguistic minorities. the minority quota caught the attention of sp's shailendra kumar and the jd(u) representative as well with both demanding the issue should be discussed in the budget session. both parties said they favoured reservation benefits to disadvantaged sections of minorities but expressed concern over how such promises will be executed. assembly elections 2012 up assembly elections /div>

reply #3 on: today at 10:18:18 am ? reply #4 on: today at 10:56:56 am ? well, even that report took a few days to resurface (i've had it before though). i tried to reproduce it when i asked in general discussion about bug reports (with regards to the new version coming) and couldn't do it until i wasn't actively trying anymore it was always after having run evehq for quite some time doing lots of calculating, price updating, custom-price-removal by hand, readding it in bpcalc, ... not something that leads to easily reproducible chain of events i do have a wild guess as to a possible cause (which i've only found/resolved long after posting that initial crash): i decided to look into price groups to get more accurate prices by setting different patters for various items, which led me to notice that there was clearly something wrong with my [global] price group. apparently somehow, at some point (possibly years ago?) the global price group might have actually contained all items not covered by other groups? in any case i noticed that it contained every item in the game multiple times, for whatever reason. i only noticed it because i couldn't add any item to any price group, as they would always display with a red x. luckily the "clear all" button for the global group still works, while the "add" button understandably doesn't (anymore?). could every item being actually present in the global group (and multiple times at that, for whatever reason) be somehow related to this?

T	[cork] ***banging at the breakfast bar*** ~april playdate please~
C	client requests [cork] ***banging at the breakfast bar*** ~april playdate please~ [cork] ***banging at the breakfast bar*** ~april playdate please~ hi ladies, how are you all? just wanted to see if there would be any takers on this little idea of mine. basically i'd like to have some fun and games at the breakfast bar with you sitting pretty on a high stool or chair. i totally understand that some ladies might not be comfortable allowing a client into another room other than the bedroom. some ladies will be which would be very cool, for those that are not, a chair in the bedroom works just as good for me, whatever you are most comfortable with. i'm going to post a few pics to show you exactly what i mean and would like. anal would be great but if it's not a favourite you do, that's no problem at all, it's not that essential. the stripper heels would be very appreciated by me though if you have a pair like in the pics. if you have any suggestions on this, think it's something you are up for trying and would like to discuss an appointment, please feel free to post here or pm me, all pm's (if any) will be answered. you may not post new threads you may not post replies you may not post attachments you may not edit your posts

T	the javafx scenebuilder tool | dr dobb's
C	 oracle recently released a preview of a new tool to help with gui layout for javafx 2.x applications, called the javafx scenebuilder. it's available for windows, mac os x, and linux, and you can download it here . it's available on all of these platforms because it's built on java itself. it sports a very clean, easy-to-use interface, which is consistent with the javafx mantra. here's the screen as greeted when you start the application: you can then add layouts, shapes, and controls to the canvas, position and resize them as you please, and save when you're done. to do so, simply drag-and-drop from the available components in the list along the left, into the correct area of your canvas in the middle. the result is an fxml file, which is an xml-based layout structure used by javafx, and combined with a css file, to form the skinned gui of your application. bind code to gui if you save this file along with the source code for your javafx project in netbeans, you can bind elements of your gui in scenebuilder, along with associated events and actions, with your code. to do so, you need to have the elements defined in your code, usually within a controller class, select the relevant component in scenebuilder, and set the controller class in the document section along the right-hand navigation (see figure below). you define the appropriate elements in your code as such: package mycooljavafxapp; import java.net.url; import java.util.resourcebundle; import javafx.event.actionevent; import javafx.fxml.fxml; import javafx.fxml.initializable; import javafx.scene.control.button; public class appcontroller implements initializable { @fxml button hellobtn; @override public void initialize(url url, resourcebundle rb) { } public void onhellobutton(actionevent event) { system.out.println("hello, world!"); } } next, you can bind a control's event by selecting the control, then the proper event method from the drop-down list within the events section of the tool, as shown below: currently we allow the following html tags in comments: single tags these tags can be used alone and don't need an ending tag. defines a horizontal line matching tags these require an ending tag - e.g. italic text defines big text defines a long quotation defines emphasized text defines a border around elements in a form this is heading 2 this is heading 3 this is heading 5 this is heading 6 defines a paragraph defines preformatted text defines sample computer code text defines strikethrough text defines strikethrough text what the new ipad and ios 5.1 mean for developers the new display is gorgeous. but local storage for hmtl5 is currently broken on the new ipad and performance of some apps is slower. here's a deep dive into the issues, including benchmarks and analysis. triple buffering as a concurrency mechanism triple buffering is a way of passing data between a producer and a consumer running at different rates. it ensures that the consumer sees only complete data with minimal lag. printf("hello,\n"); embed_breakpoint; printf("world!\n"); mobile device management ebook: your guide to the essentials and beyond redefining value and success in healthcare: charting the path to the future improving the efficiency, accuracy and cost effectiveness of core business activities data center design for the 21st century- best practices from the data center operational efficiency study best practices for improving database testing: upgrades, migrations, business growth and more - ensuring you can handle the workload! health insurance billing strategies: preparing for an uncertain future

T	appeasing the ratings agencies is bad policy | touchstone blog: a public policy blog from the tuc
C	duncan weldon my eye was caught this morning by a story headlined - it opens by discussing the impact of the government's current policy on the supposedly 'ring-fenced' nhs: britain is forcing stephen jobling and his stroke patients to defend the nation's aaa credit rating. staffing at the national health service hospital ward where jobling works was reduced by about half in the u.k.'s deepest drive since world war ii to shrink its deficit. the goal was to avoid losing the top credit score, which might risk higher interest expenses, according to the government of conservative prime minister david cameron . "if they could see these people suffering while we have two members of nursing staff running round trying to wash, dress and feed 20 patients, they would think twice," says jobling, 27, a nurse at lincoln county hospital in eastern england. "you should be looking after your people. you shouldn't be bothering about some credit agency from somewhere else." the bond market says he's right. after moody's investors service issued a "negative" outlook for u.k. debt on feb. 13, yields on government securities relative to benchmark u.s. treasury debt fell over the next month, instead of rising. the article then proceeds to quote a variety of eminent figures views on the rating agencies that government policy is aiming to appease. bank of england governor sir meryn king - "i don't think we should be slaves to the ratings agencies. what we've seen is, the action they took recently did actually have no impact on the yield that people in the market were willing to lend to the u.k. government at."" finance professor john hund - ratings agencies "have more potential to do harm than good. it's hard for me to see their value." nobel prize winner paul krugman - ""their austerity is leading to depressed economies, which is worsening fiscal prospects," krugman said in an interview may 9. "you're kind of in an endless downward loop here, where you cut and the fiscal prospect looks worse, so to keep the rating agencies happy, you cut more." former mpc member danny blanchflower - "how do you have any faith in them given they were part problem?" chief economist at bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj chris rupkey - "it's almost as if they're trying to admonish the countries to get their financial books in order. they're really doing the world a huge disservice by frightening financial markets." most damningly, vincent truglia, a fund manager and former head of sovereign ratings at moodys argues that - "the u.k. shouldn't care at all what its rating is, a rating is not what you're supposed to be interested in. you're supposed to be interested in the right public policy." i couldn't agree more. targeting a credit rating rather than economic growth was always going to be self-defeating. perhaps the most interesting thing about this article though isn't the contents but the source: bloomberg. this is an article that will be read by financial professionals the world over, the very people the government is aiming to satisfy.

T	eacs wants to gauge educational aspects of what's being accomplished - news-sentinel.com
C	 much discussion has occurred about the presentation of the eacs perceptions and recommendations report by dr. yost. while there are things in the report that must be addressed, the decision eacs now has to make is how to seek a balanced view of the happenings in east allen county schools. since the report, i have received dozens of calls, emails and visits from people within the district, many of whom take issue with several things about the report but who most of all feel their input is not represented. many of the calls i've had are from people who met with dr. yost during this time, yet whose perceptions are not accounted for. this study was originally proposed as a look to the future for eacs. where can we go from here to strengthen the good things happening in east allen county schools? the basic question to be answered by this study was "where should eacs be by 2015/2020?". some of the "thought questions" presented to the board when dr. yost submitted his proposal for the study were: ?what do you think are the most significant differentiators of eacs - in comparison to other school districts? ?are these differentiators important to learning? ?how should "excellence" be defined? ?where should eacs focus its attention over the next 10 years? what the study ended up being was a report based on the "personal side of the district." how do people "feel" after undergoing significant change - the closing of five schools, transferring hundreds of students, addressing the mandates coming from the state department of education and the legislature, reducing more than 100 positions? the personal side of leadership, while valuable is just one of many aspects found within leadership at any level. and they are certainly things the board and administration can learn from this report about the personal side of leadership. but now the discussion needs to focus on assessing the educational initiatives and improvements happening in the district - the things for which eacs is held accountable by the state and federal government: the increasing demands on student achievement, the expiration of our contract with teachers (2016) and becoming compliant with the state compensation model based on student achievement, the requirement to reduce suspension and expulsion of students, the moving target of school ratings. in other words, how can eacs best assess those educational aspects related to why it exists as a public school district? how is a balanced view of the education we provide going to be assessed? the board is suggesting, now that we've gauged the relational side of the district, to gauge the educational aspects of what's being accomplished. those accomplishments include: ?instituting academic opportunities that have never been offered before ?raising test scores by more than 4 percent across the district ?implementing a district redesign after years of paralysis and non-action ?creating financial stability ?developing a more effective facility usage plan across the district ?designing a comprehensive five-year strategic plan for curriculum, instruction and assessment ?increasing opportunities for high school students to earn college credit ?providing alternative pathways for students to get their high school diploma ?continuing to offer summer programming k-12 ?creating, a collaborative environment (recognized by the u.s. doe) with the teachers association ?developing a graduated discipline program ?providing an in-house leadership training program (administrative university) for all administration ?offering professional development to district administrators across our region the board is proposing to utilize an educational organization such as the indiana school boards association as a guide through this process. the isba provides several board services including self-assessments, effective governance and conflict resolution. but, for our purposes, their goal-setting training seems to address the need for an assessment of our educational program. according to mike adamson, isba director of board services, isba offers a retreat, which "brings boards and administrative teams together focusing on the crucial foundational steps in goal-setting." there are opportunities, throughout this process, for community members to become involved. let me assure you that my concern about dr. yost's report is not about my employment as has been expressed by some. a report such as this is not unique to east allen. it's not unlike the craziness that happens when someone new comes into an organization, brings about change and addresses those issues, which have been hanging out there for years. it's not unlike what happens when one makes unpopular decisions based on what's right for kids. this is about east allen county schools and what we do for kids every day. let's not take our eyes off our educational progress. let's not take our eyes off our strengths. let's work to improve where necessary and build those relationships where they may be lacking. but, our achievement, our growth, our academic progress and future educational success are far too important to be waylaid now. karyle green is superintendent of east allen county schools in new haven.

T	local paralympian's spirit surmounts all obstacles - sports - reviewjournal.com
C	 local paralympian's spirit surmounts all obstacles cortney jordan, who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when she was 2, will be a senior this fall at cal lutheran in thousand oaks, calif., and is studying to be an elementary school teacher. posted: jun. 28, 2012 | 2:02 a.m. i wonder if those doctors are watching, hearing, reading, learning about the incredible young woman and athlete cortney jordan has become. i wonder if they have any idea. the human spirit continues to be our healthy core, the one feature we own that other beings don't, the one element that often overrides a medical opinion. jordan's spirit is contagious. it is limitless. she has qualified to swim in a second paralympic games and will be among those favored in london this summer to stand on a podium and have a gold medal slipped around her neck and place her hand over her heart as the national anthem plays. "i don't think words could ever describe that feeling," jordan said. "i love my country. my father always taught us to love and respect it, and to be able to compete for it is an incredible thing." her father, dirk, is retired air force, and her mother, nancy, is the person who taught her to never stop attacking those hurdles set in front of her by cerebral palsy, the disorder doctors diagnosed when cortney was 2. they said she always would be slow in school and unable to learn with the swiftness of other children. how ironic. she instead became a person who teaches others. jordan graduated coronado high with a weighted 4.7 grade-point average and will begin her senior year in the fall at cal lutheran in thousand oaks, calif., a liberal arts college where she continues to pursue her dream of becoming an elementary school teacher; where she tutors foreign students in writing; where she swims with the same passion and purpose that won her a gold, two silvers and a bronze at the paralympic games in beijing four years ago. a standard definition: the paralympic games are a major international multisport event where athletes with physical disabilities compete immediately following their respective olympic games. a clearer one: they are what sportsmanship and fair play and embodying the true spirit of competition is all about. "getting to london was always a goal, and it means even more with a schedule of swimming and student-teaching and tutoring at the writing center," jordan said. "i'm up at 5 a.m. and home at 8 p.m. and then have homework. i don't have a social life. my roommates never see me. "but i'm as determined as ever. i love what i do. i love helping people learn to write. i want to teach my whole life." for years, she felt hers was a bad hand dealt in the game of life. she was teased as a child about her condition, about being in a pool and her brain telling her left leg to kick and it never moving below the surface, about being limited to only using her right arm because her left wouldn't fully extend from the water. kids can be cruel this way. their heartless remarks can feast on another's challenge. but then she began to grow and mature and realize that normal wasn't all that exciting, that cerebral palsy made her a better person, a more compassionate one, a more patient and understanding one. "i'm thankful for it now," jordan said. "i see the world differently because of it. i'm doing really well now, but my (condition) will get harder to deal with as i age. i'm always in some kind of pain. it hurts to walk and stand in one place. but i can always go to the pool, float in the water and feel better. i will always have that." the paralympics are special in that the youngest swimmer who will compete for the u.s. this summer is 14 and the oldest is 50. jordan turned 21 over the weekend and, not surprisingly, has become a mentor to many of the sport's younger competitors. she remembers being the same nervous, insecure, anxious child standing on a platform at a national event. there was such an 11-year-old named amanda at one meet in ohio, crying before her race, stricken also with cerebral palsy, searching for a hand to guide her. one did, taking the girl to a warmup pool, swimming in front of her, protecting her from the normal kicks and punches swimmers inadvertently give each other when preparing for a race. she then stood at the opposite end of the pool when it came time for the girl to compete, cheering her every stroke. i wonder if those doctors have a clue about the incredible person cortney jordan is. registration notice: the review-journal has implemented a new registration procedure that requires all existing and new accounts to validate and login using facebook. visit the registration faq for more information. terms & conditions the following comments are provided by readers and are the sole responsiblity of the authors. the review-journal does not review comments before publication nor guarantee their accuracy. by publishing a comment here you agree to abide by the comment policy . if you see a comment that violates the policy, please use the report abuse button. some comments may not display immediately due to an automatic filter. these comments will be reviewed within 24 hours. please do not submit a comment more than once. photos: male striptease: the men of sapphire in las vegas blue man group | thu. 6/28 7:00 p.m. blue man group | thu. 6/28 7:00 p.m.

C	 west valley home market as hot as the weather demand greatest for homes under $150k by lesley wright - jun. 18, 2012 08:21 am javier vidana is only 19. but with his investor father's cash, he was ready to make an offer on a three-bedroom, 21/2 bath home in peoria on thursday. "i love it already," said vidana, who rents a room in a phoenix house. "i don't want to be living in a little room anymore." his real-estate agent, jesse abarca, said vidana and his father will have to be ready to make a solid cash offer literally the hour the house hits the market. even then, they could get outbid. "the game is to get an offer in as soon as possible to avoid the other bidders," said abarca, who works for re/max professionals in glendale. for real-estate agents, homebuyers and especially homesellers, the west valley is burning up, especially for homes less than $150,000. "the west valley is really, really a hot market," said chris heagerty, director of the arizona regional multiple listing service inc. that heat is strongest in the market for homes of $100,000 to $150,000, forcing new buyers to move to higher ranges. the sellers of the small, empty house vidana has his eye on are aiming it at the hottest part of the investor's market -- homes from $110,000 to $130,000. distressed properties, those houses owned by people facing foreclosure or short sales, still make up the bulk of sales. but armls statistics show they have decreased in metro phoenix to about 43 percent in may. that's a drop compared with their high-water mark in september 2010, when distressed properties made up 74 percent of homes sold. cheryl evans/the republic javier vidana (left), of phoenix, and real estate agent jesse abarca view a home for sale in peoria. a snapshot of distressed real estate market the continuing clean-out of distressed properties appears to be escalating in the west valley. the may report by the arizona regional multiple listing service inc. shows that the areas with the fewest distressed properties are avondale, buckeye, goodyear, peoria, surprise, glendale, tempe and the san tan valley. areas with the highest number of distressed properties include mesa, scottsdale, central phoenix, gilbert and chandler. here is the armls breakdown for the last three years showing the percent of distressed properties in closed sales:

T	utahconcealedcarry.com ? view topic - ammo storage question
C	so i had a good find this past weekend. i was cleaning my garage and found a 1000 round case of 5.56mm and another 1000 round case of 9mm. i totally forgot about them. i now remember buying them in the winter about 3 years ago and put them up out of the way. these were to be my emergency prep and bartering ammo. the ammo is about 9 feet high up on a garage shelf that gets probably 120+ in the summer and 32- in the winter. both calibers are fmj american eagle with brass cases. i was reading that the most damaging thing to ammo is moisture and here in utah we have very little of that. in the garage i could dig them out easier if a disaster happened. also up high there is little risk of water damage from a broke pipe during said disaster. what condition do you think the ammo is in baking and freezing for 3 years? is it fine to leave it there or should i store them under the stairs in the basement where it's cooler? oppressors can tyrannize only when they achieve a standing army, an enslaved press, and a disarmed populace. - james madison liberty is preserved with 4 boxes: soap, jury, ballot, and cartridge. - dan skinner knayrb marksman posts: i would put it in a cool dry place, but i would guess they are fine where they are. all it takes for evil to succeed in the world is for good men to do nothing i just did a quick search and found a record low temperature for sandy, ut in january of -15?f. 10 joined: sat 02 jun 2012 10:07 am i'd consider replacing it with new, storing the new, and gradually shooting up the old, temperature cycled ammo. endowment life member nra, nra instructor, nra range safety officer, wsa range officer, utah concealed firearm permit (cfp) instructor, ut cfp, az & id cwp, saf & jpfo lm, uspsa, idpa, dewittdj sniper posts: 1916 joined: sat 07 aug 2010 10:36 pm alanm wrote: your garage gets to -32?f???? i just did a quick search and found a record low temperature for sandy, ut in january of -15?f. the average low temperature for the year bottoms out at about +20?f there. yo!

of course the only proper way to dispose of it is to shoot it...right? ok...the ammo should be good and to follow the advise given so far. ian the first and second amendments are so intertwined that that we can not have one without the other. and if there comes a time when we lose both, the united states will cease as we know it. ian husford sniper posts: i meant 32 degrees or less. kind of like 40 days and 40 nights = a long time. the point is that it get very hot and very cold. i guess my post didn't come off as a friendly ribbing as i meant it to be. makes sense now that you clarified it. as to your original question, i agree with the others, the ammo is most probably good to go. also, i've found that ever since 2004 when i got my first concealed carry license (in ohio) i've become much more tolerant of annoying, immature people both in person and on line. i now just tend to ignore them rather than waste my time and energy slapping them down. over the last 65 years i've observed several times that time wounds all heels. i have to say this here alan... did you know you have a raccoon on your shoulder? using the lessons i've gleaned from zombie movies, i would recommend you have at least one round of ammunition per person currently living within a 30 mile radius of your location... sam fidler on mon 23 jul 2012 12:48 am i have been working in iraq for about 5 years not where the summer days regularly hold at 120 and temps inside dark suburbans are much higher. ammo stored in these extremely hot conditions for many years have fired without failure. we have been using this old ammo over the past few months in our quarterly quals without any noticeable effect in accuracy. i say, if it doesn't show excessive signs of corrosion, shoot it.

C	 we are all loving miss tyra. i've read that boxers are especially good with children and she definitely is. it doesn't even phase her when roman points out her ears and eyes and attempts to ride her like a horse. she will bark when a new person comes to the door but will stop as soon as she smells them and realizes that they aren't a threat. if that same person comes over another day, she won't bark at them at all. and she is so, so, so sweet. i don't want to speak too soon but brooklyn has been extremely responsible with tyra. each morning, she takes her for a long walk, feeds her, and brushes her. she does the same thing in the evening. and then there is ruby. dan came home from vegas on friday with a 2 month old teacup chihuahua puppy. apparently a renter owed him money and paid him in chihuahua. i'm amazed that he accepted her but i think surprising the girls weighed out the craziness of another puppy. since tyra is mostly brooklyn's, ruby is mostly delylah's. i don't think she has put her down in 3 days. she really is the size of the remote. it is funny to see her pounce around, trying to keep up.

T	christmas - holiday - seasonal centerpieces
C	 by decorating with natural holiday and seasonal centerpieces! sure to dress up, and add some holiday cheer to any room in your home ...but especially for those dining room and kitchen tables . as you know , nc are huge fans of using natural holiday decor to add warmth , sweet aromas , and bring in a beautiful display of natural resources from mother nature. with these inspiring photos from bhg.com , we are sure to create something similar for our holiday decorating clients this season in are so excited to decorate residential and commercial properties in charlotte , nc and the metro area , including upper sc for the upcoming season and put a twist on typical holiday table decor with a tree-inspired centerpiece . to create the trunk, wrap a clear glass vase with bark chips. surround the vase with faux variegated moss and top with nuts, berries, and tiny decorative birds to mimic a forest setting. bring the "tree" into bloom with a lush floral arrangement of hydrangeas, roses, fresh greenery, and hypericum berries. tray of yews holiday centerpiece foot-high yews with root balls nestled in moss look fresh lined up in a galvanized tray. you can find these mini evergreens at your local nursery. anchor with white and purple eggplants for an all-natural centerpiece. editor's tip: to keep plants from drying out, place out of direct sunlight and water twice a week. limit display time to 2-3 weeks; after three weeks, trees will come out of winter hibernation and start to grow like houseplants. white hyacinth holiday centerpiece this centerpiece filled with seasonal , natural elements is versatile enough for any holiday occasion. simply fill a large, low bowl with boxwood, pinecones, and white hyacinth. elevate a humble wooden box to christmas-centerpiece status. start by lining the box with dry florist's foam to anchor evergreen sprigs. attach citrus fruits (lemons, oranges, limes) to florist's picks and tuck into the greenery. add interest by cutting some of the fruits in half or adding decorative details. editor's tip: make orange pomanders by using a large needle to poke holes into the orange. push the stems of whole cloves into the holes. white gold decorations large white hydrangea blooms fill a white pitcher (or try a bowl!) with fresh floral splendor. we added seeded eucalyptus leaves and a few stalks of white snaps and filled in with golden holiday ornaments on wires. fresh green and red apple slices surround the neutral centerpiece with a bright border. think small holiday decorations instead of one gigantic centerpiece, consider making several smaller bouquets for the table. a silver ornament and sprigs of evergreen are nods to the holiday season , but this idea is versatile: flowers could be any color or type that complements your china and table linens. flowers and votives a block of soaked florist's foam holds this arrangement in place. three glass votive cups were set on top of the foam -- making it easy to change the candles as needed. curly twigs inserted into the foam hold the glass cups in place. next, flowers and greens are arranged around the sides of the foam, draping down to the tabletop. usually run the length of the table. for something different, keep the centerpiece in the middle of the table, but stretch it across the width instead. here, evergreen boughs drape across the table horizontally and are accented with pretty red flowers and white berry sprigs. serving up sophistication a pair of stacked cake plates dressed with evergreens, glass balls, pinecones, and red berries makes a sophisticated, no-fuss centerpiece. all boxed up a rustic wooden toolbox lets a holiday centerpiece spread out. stand pillar candles on supports, such as candleholders or even soup cans, so they are set at different heights. next, add bowls or low containers of damp florist's foam and arrange the greenery. a sweep of garland and a cardinal's nest add a final touch. editor's tip: be sure to keep the candle flames a safe distance from the greenery and other elements. photos and articles about each photo courtesy of more about me? interior redesign-design, home staging & holiday decorating disclaimer: activerain corp. does not necessarily endorse the real estate agents, loan officers and brokers listed on this site. these real estate profiles,

T	what is the role of website in business? | custom website designs that transform your web site?s success!
C	frankly speaking, no one can deliver an actual answer to this question. it genuinely rely on the concept of design and purpose of one's website. it can be anything from the range of a mere window to a sophisticated and complex system that forms the lifeline of a business. however, a straightaway decision can be lethal and one should go step by step keeping all the probabilities in mind. there are several people who are unaware of the actual benefit with a website. for such people this article can be a jackpot! if one talks about a simpler version of a company website then it would consists of a bunch of institutional pages, which comprises of a home page where one can welcome his/her visitors and tell something about them. other related pages comprise of company history, contact information etc. if the site is meant for selling products, then it should include pages displaying them, it is better to display with pictures. such website does not demand much maintenance, and also lead several new clients to doorsteps. moving little bit ahead, one can take his/her institutional site and adjoin a newsletter service. so that clients and visitors coming to the site can sign up to get a periodic email regarding details and news about the concern company. by this way one can easily understand that who is actually interested in dealing with the company about solutions and products. another benefit is that it will produce an aspect of loyalty. with this one will remain in regular touch of prospective clients. one more step which one can include in his/her procedure is to offer support to the clients on the website. it can be everything ranging from email support, a tickets system to live chat. one can go for anything according to his/her requirements. executing a forum for the purpose of providing answers to questions and for creating a community of users can also be effective. if user is selling products possessing print manuals, he/she can produce pdf versions of these manuals and can make them available on website for downloading purpose. after accomplishing the above-mentioned step one needs to take a very crucial step. one can move a branch of his/her business to the web. for instance, one can allow a form where customers can submit their quote requests. rather one can comprise of a shopping cart for the purpose of selling all the products straightaway. one should understand that the above-mentioned steps are mere possibilities actual procedure is everlasting. while thinking one should give priority to his/her company, and also the things of which one can make use. if user's job comprises of much traveling then a password-protected tool for visualizing necessary information anywhere can be very helpful. after reaching to the conclusion that one requires a website for his/her company, he/she should necessitate the following: 1. a person for the purpose of making the web site i.e. a web designer , other than that it is better to have a web programmer if user's strategy comprises of a site with the features beyond a mere small institutional site. if one can do the above-mentioned tasks without outside help then it is well and good. or it is also better to get a person specialized in both designing and programming tasks. 2. after the registration of a domain name like www.one's-company.com, one can use it until it crosses the period of expiration. one can register it for any time period like for instance one, two, or ten years. one can decrease the cost of annual fee with the registration of several years at the same period of time. 3. one can host his/her website at the place called hosting company, where it is easy for the site to reach to numerous amount of visitors. one should select a hosting plan after doing proper analyzation of his/her requirements. in web hosting market one can find several companies with variety of packages and prices. if user possesses a small scale website, then a very expensive package with numerous features is not the right choice. it is quite important that the hosting company is serious and reliable. in case one is creating a business website, then it is not at all advisable to host it in a free server as it will create bad effect on one's image and goodwill. bbb rating for king & son equity group based on bbb files, king & son equity group has a bbb rating

about kings & son equity group that claims to be located in arkansas. after investigation, the bbb has confirmed there is no such company at that address. consumers should be aware that the lender's names may also be false, and no such individuals may exist. this business has been soliciting clients who have been researching loan options online. consumers are being told they do not qualify for a traditional loan, but this business can help. they are then directed to complete a loan application requesting personal information such as social security number, date of birth, employment information and monthly income. the bbb has reviewed a copy of a loan agreement contract. it states that an amount totaling several monthly loan payments must be paid upfront. the consumers are given instructions to wire the fee to an individual usually located in canada. the loan agreement also states that the funds will be released to the consumer no later than one business day from the time the

contact and profile for king & son equity group name: king & son equity group phone: (877) 318-3413 address: 219 w capitol little rock, ar 72201 principal: mr. christopher king, ceo customer contact:

read and understand company promotional materials and contracts and check company references and licensing, where applicable. the bbb urges caution when solicited by a company who promises a loan in exchange for a fee in advance. according to the federal trade commission, it is illegal for companies doing business by phone in the u.s. to promise a loan and ask for a payment before they deliver. consumers are typically given instructions to send the fee by wire transfer to a location outside of the united states, and they have little recourse if there is a problem with the transaction. the arkansas attorney general's office recommends you report your experience with advanced fee loan companies to the federal trade commission (ftc) and phonebusters. phonebusters is the canadian anti-fraud call center. the call center plays a vital role in the collection and dissemination of victim evidence, statistics, and documentation which are made available to outside law enforcement agencies. 877-ftc-help (877-382-4357) tty: 866-653-4261 888-495-8501 if you have provided your personal information, the bbb recommends that you file a fraud alert with the three major credit reporting agencies. you only need to contact one of the three companies to place an alert; the company you call is required to contact the other two. skills: website designer search engine

C	 my co-workers and i had a great time this past weekend at the national book festival in washington d.c.! wells fargo sponsored the history and biography tent, and we had a large area in the let's read america tent. both days were packed with activities-building stagecoach banks, live readings, having pictures taken inside a replica stagecoach, artifact talks, giveaways... the big hit: the stagecoach! no surprise there. it's definitely an attention-getter wherever it goes! , i was very happy to see a dad, with his cute toddler on his shoulders, choose the spanish version. "he can learn some spanish!" he told me. yay, bilingualism! it was a very large festival, but after getting many, many questions about them, i think i can safely say that our snowflake plush ponies were the most coveted item at the festival! saturday was especially busy, and hot, but at the end of the day our tired historical team perked up after a gentleman came to thank us, to say that we were very professional and knowledgeable, and that he appreciated our work. it was a great end to the day! your questions and comments really matter to us! we're glad you want to join the conversation and connect with other wells fargo - guided by history blog readers. all we ask is that you keep some simple guidelines in mind: stay on-topic. only comments that are related to the subject of the blog entry will be posted. be respectful. it's okay if you disagree with a post or comment, but please, no personal attacks or offensive language. maintain your privacy and confidentiality. please do not provide any of your specific account details or other personal information! if you have immediate service needs, please contact your bank representative or customer service. wells fargo or wachovia team members : in the interest of full disclosure, if you are a current employee of or are associated with either wells fargo or wachovia , please make note of your affiliation. please note by posting content on this blog, you expressly grant wells fargo (and its affiliates) the right to use or distribute the posted content in any form, worldwide, and in perpetuity. you also agree to indemnify and hold wells fargo harmless against all liabilities, losses, claims and expenses arising from your posting of materials on this blog (this includes any claim that wells fargo's use of the content of images infringes on someone else's intellectual property rights). please read our community guidelines for more information. if you have immediate service needs or require a follow-up, please contact your bank representative or relationship manager. if you submit your email address, we will use it only if we need additional information about your comment, or if we need to contact you to resolve service issues mentioned in your comment.

C	online degree search provided by yourdegree results dynamic analysis of vascular morphogenesis using transgenic quail embryos tue, 2010-09-14 09:00 - anonymous background one of the least understood and most central questions confronting biologists is how initially simple clusters or sheet-like cell collectives can assemble into highly complex three-dimensional functional tissues and organs. due to the limits of oxygen diffusion, blood vessels are an essential and ubiquitous presence in all amniote tissues and organs. vasculogenesis, the de novo self-assembly of endothelial cell (ec) precursors into endothelial tubes, is the first step in blood vessel formation [1]. static imaging and in vitro models are wholly inadequate to capture many aspects of vascular pattern formation in vivo, because vasculogenesis involves dynamic changes of the endothelial cells and of the forming blood vessels, in an embryo that is changing size and shape. the primary objective of the sts-99

analysis smap-3 by www.addaptron.com is able to extract basic cycles of the stock market (indexes, sectors, or well-traded shares). to build an extrapolation (prediction), it uses the following two-step approach (1) applying spectral (time series) analysis to decompose the curve into basic functions, (2) composing these functions beyond the historical data. it also enables finding optimal timing to buy/sell by analyzing month of year, day of month, and day of week (the calculation is based on statistical analysis). the investors who empowered by using smap are less likely to get fooled into buying at the worst time. the stock market has powerful and consistent cycles. they can be as a bad surprise for some investors but others know how to take advantage of the market cycles. by identifying the cycles it is possible to anticipate tops and bottoms and to determine trends. the stock market cycles can be a good opportunity to maximize return on investments. the presence of multiple cycles of different periods and magnitudes in conjunction with linear trends, can form a complex pattern of the stock market performance curve. often cycles mask themselves - sometimes they overlap to form an abnormal extremum or offset to form a flat period. it is clear that a simple chart analysis has a certain limit in identifying cycles parameters and using them for predicting. from:

affordable care act, there have been numerous actions in federal courts to challenge the constitutionality of the legislation.[1][2] this article deals with the challenges by states against the patient protection and affordable care act, reactions from legal experts with respect to the ppaca's constitutionality, several federal court rulings on the ppaca's constitutionality and the final ruling on the constitutionality of the legislation by the us supreme court in national federation of independent business v. sebelius. almost immediately after the passage of the affordable care act, the virginia state legislature passed a law that purported to nullify the individual mandate provision of the federal act.[26] virginia attorney general ken cuccinelli then sued secretary of health and human services kathleen sebelius in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia. cuccinelli's lawsuit was separate from the states participating in florida's lawsuit. the case was heard by judge henry e. hudson, who was appointed to the bench by george w. bush. on may 24, 2010, the obama administration filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that states cannot escape

notes with maturities of 2, 5 and 10 years. at the end (right) of the yield curve are treasury bonds with maturities of 20 and 30 years. in a normal yield curve, yields rise as the maturities increase. if the yield on shorter maturities is higher than that of longer maturities, then an inverted yield curve is said to exist. an inverted yield curve is a sign of tight money and is bearish

"we had some wind turbulence along the way, but everything worked out ok," mr. claus, accompanied by his wife, told the crowd in kellogg park after stepping off a fire truck, which had circled the park with lights flashing and siren blaring to the great excitement of younger visitors. the jolly old elf's stop at the park, accented by a brief snow flurry, marked the official start of the holiday season in downtown plymouth. the north pole's most famous resident helped light up the park's christmas tree and the giant menorah figure, accepted the key to the city from city commissioner ed hingelberg, and held court for kids and their wish lists in his santa house, the line for which soon stretched nearly the entire length of the park. "there is no place like plymouth in the whole wide world," hingelberg said as he gave santa the giant key. santa also introduced the "fantabulous" choir from the plymouth-canton educational park high schools, which led the crowd in a spirited version of rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. the choir and christine belisario, who performs a variety show as christmas carol, had warmed up the crowd before santa's 6 p.m. arrival. "it's just nice to see neighbors out and about and everybody bundled up for winter," said kristin adamski of plymouth, who was there with husband ray and their sons, evan, 9, brendan, 8, carter, 6, and cameron, 4. the adamskis have made greeting santa a day-after-thanksgiving tradition, saying they had been to the event for eight straight years. carter, asked what he thought of santa's appearance, gave it an enthusiastic thumbs-up. kristin adamski said her family likes to see the christmas tree light up every year and then walk around the park to look at the decorations. "it makes a nice memory for them - they were there when the lights went on," she said. "it makes the whole rest of the season very special." plymouth crowd greets snow and santa undeterred by a sudden dip in the temperature and what must be a hectic season for him, santa claus made his scheduled visit to plymouth friday evening, greeted by hundreds of children and their

T	dealing with a difficult neighbor - college confidential
C	the leading college-bound community on the web , and start talking with other members, weighing in on community polls, and more. dealing with a difficult neighbor i have a situation with a neighbor and would like some other wisdom (mainly from other moms...keep reading and you'll understand) i am going to give some detail as to help "paint the picture" so the advise can be tailored for this situation. we live in nice neighborhood and it used to be mainly retirement folks, but the town is moving from retirement community to young family type community. there is a pretty equal mix at this point and then there are a handful of us who bridge that, kids in college and some older school aged kiddos. so when we moved here and the lady next door had a daughter the same age as our youngest child (now 10) the kids became fast friends more out of location, than commonality, but it worked and has been plugging along for 2 years although my daughter sees it as a take it or leave it situation at this point and has for about 6 months. when we moved in, i found it interesting that the neighbor, we'll call her diane, told my husband that i was "one of those kinds of moms." i really didn't understand what she meant by that, nor did he, because i am not suzy pta and i am truly a t-shirt and blue jean kind of mom, not pushing the fashion envelope like i would say the majority of moms in this area do. this mom is in a job that causes her to be focused on her appearance, she works long hours and dresses very well, so i have not idea if this is slam or just a judgement, but i really don't care. fast forward to this year. my daughter is a cheerleader and pretty good tumbler but does not want to participate in the highly competitive land of high profile texas cheerleading. she did however want to participate in the youth association program in our community and i was fine with that. she had a friend in her tumbling class, they signed up together, cross registered with each other and we were set. two days before registration was to close diane came over and asked me to call our assigned coach to see if her daughter could be on squad with my daughter. this was not the ideal situation for many reasons, but i am seriously laid back about these things and it was a "whatever" for me and i used it as a lesson in acceptance for my daughter (i think my daughter was looking forward to an activity that didn't include this child, as it a relationship that is optional for my daughter but has become dependent for neighbor's child) the only weird part about it was that when ever my daughter would give her cheer friend attention at practice, neighbor's daughter would get all out of sorts. i would not call diane and i friends as much as i would call us neighbors that have always been friendly to each other. because she works, i at times make sure her daughter has a snack after school, etc and that her homework gets done. diane and i have polar opposite political views and although i would not say i am a radical by any means, i have participated in friendly debates with friends on issues during the election. diane and i are friends on fb, yet we never participated in said debates. fast forward to the second to last cheer practice of the season, a week before the election and diane comes up to me in practice and literally out of no where starts yelling at me in regard to my political beliefs. there was another mom sitting by me and she gets up and basically asks her what her issue is. she yells that i think i am better than everyone else and she can't stand it anymore. goes on to tell me that my political beliefs are so beyond wrong that she does not understand how i can even live. she tells me she can't stand what i say on fb, etc, so that night i tell my husband about it and he swears i had to provoke her. he calls the friend that was with me (my husband is friends with her husband) and she confirms that it literally came out of no where. he tells me to just de-friend her and let it settle down. about 5 minutes after the de-friend she sends me a text message that she has never been happier with a decision that someone else made (i didn't answer) and then at 1:00 am that morning i get another message that she recommends i go get psych treatment. (again, i was irritated, but did not answer) friend from cheer practice says she is just high strung and probably does not understand how i take life on the "chill" side. (except college admissions....lol) her daughter is a little on the "outside" of school social circles and my daughter (very unlike her older siblings) is very much the social butterfly. cheer friend thinks this is the core of her issues. sounds like she kind of lost it... but if i were you, i would see if i could re-establish at least a cordial speaking relationship, since she is a nearby neighbor. the election is over, and some of the feelings that were running high a month ago may be down to a simmer again. i would not avoid her, would speak about something superficial, and give it another go without giving her a real inside track to your life -- don't invite her into your house, for instance, or back into your fb friends list. and i sure wouldn't take over a cake. it does sound like she has some jealousy issues, and maybe is under some stress if she is working long hours. sometimes people in those situations don't even realize how they come off. so i guess i would take a wary shot at seeing if you can get back on cordial terms just because it is easier for your d and to live in your neighborhood if you can. be the adult here, assume you will never get an apology, and re-establish diplomatic relations. join date: oct 2004 location: franklin, tn join date: apr 2008 location: within 100 mile radius nyc one of the hardest lessons that i learned once my daughter started school was how nutty some of the other parents were.they also were in almost any place - pta, car pool, after school activities, etc. once i find out someone is crazy, i stay as far away as i can. that does not guarantee that the crazy will not stalk you (this did happen one time to me). even if she is your neighbor, you are not obligated to be friendly if she is cracked, which it sounds like she is. now i am a chilly northerner by nature and experience, although i did live in the south for grad school, and people exchanged more pleasantries that i was used to, so you may have to be a tad more pleasant that you might elsewhere if it is the style in your area. i agree that toxic people are to be avoided, so smile and nod if you must. "she tells me she can't stand what i say on fb, etc," - do you post a lot of politicaly charged status updates? is that what she was referring to? if it bothered her so much she should've just taken you off her friends instead fo having a public, and embarassing blow up. this woman sounds like a nut. it doesn't matter what you were posting on facebook, she called you out in public. no. not okay. you are not obligated to offer any friendly overtures in my opinion and i think your husband is wrong in suggesting that you should. i have crazy next door neighbors; their children are all grown, and we have no reason to interact with them. unfortunately, it is both of them, so i have managed to be pleasant to one and then the other will go off about something. so we pretty much just ignore them. our neighborhood is not super social, so it doesn't really stand out. i will say that the last election brought out really strong emotions from the supporters of the party that i was not going to vote for. i normally love the people i work with, but most of them supported the other party and they were all worked up and angry and saying some pretty alarming things. i had no wish to engage them on this, so i kept my mouth shut. smile and nod. i personally would not go out of my way to appease someone that owes me an apology. i wouldn't ignore them, but i'd have the absolute minimum to do with them that i could. also, my husband would not push me to be friendly to someone that treated me so poorly. texting insults at 1am? join date: aug 2004 location: sf bay area

T	utahconcealedcarry.com ? view topic - can't find an ar15 lower.
C	cheyenne20 on thu 20 dec 2012 2:22 pm so, in case no one has noticed there has been a slight up tick in demand in ar guns and parts. i would appreciate your opinion here. should i place an order for a lower with a listed 4-6 mo backorder, or should i wait to see if the storm will pass? the 2nd admendment... washington didn't use his rights to free speech to defeat the british... he shot them. cheyenne20 contributing member i ordered 10 new frontier armory complete lowers yesterday. 3 or 4 for me. 3 have already "sold". that means i have a few more that could be claim. email me if you want the last couple. edit. i have no idea how long they will take to get here. utah cfp instructor utah hunters education instructor nra rifle and pistol instructor and rso front sight ambassador (ask me about memberships) paul forum owner posts: i ordered a stag lower yesterday. they quoted me a 8-10 weeks, which was what the lead time was on the stag site yesterday evening. today their site has changed to a 4-6 month lead time. i called the gun store and they said that they were told that anything that was ordered yesterday and earlier would be 8-10 weeks, but 4-6 months for anything ordered today or later. i was going to order one anyway in january for a coyote/critter gun build. i figure if everything goes back to normal in a couple of months, i'll have a lower and can probably pick up a few more for bargain prices. if some sort of awb happens, i'll still have my lower and mags. matt i couldn't afford a pair of waders, so i bought a hoodie footie and 5 cans of flex seal. mmmmmm. fuzzy. morcey2 marksman posts: i bought brand new 4 lowers from paul way back when and have been holding on to them as "spares." now i'm seriously thinking of purchasing 4 uppers, but can't find them (new) anywhere locally. the panic has appeared to have set in. i would recommend waiting ( so i can get mine first ) until after the panic subsides. it comes down to the law of supply and demand. expect to see the prices skyrocket as supplies are depleted, manufacturers run up enormous backorders, frantic buyers panic and shell out more for less. ksl classifieds may have tanked on firearms sales, but some of the alternatives for the utah crowd will provide a source of obtaining items locally that others, outside of the state, won't be able to enjoy. don't panic! wait it out! last edited by dewittdj on thu 20 dec 2012 5:08 pm, edited 2 times in total. endowment life member nra, nra instructor, nra range safety officer, wsa range officer, utah concealed firearm permit (cfp) instructor, ut cfp, az & id cwp, saf & jpfo lm, uspsa, idpa, dewittdj sniper posts: 2367 joined: sat 07 aug 2010 10:36 pm thunderstick on thu 20 dec 2012 4:46 pm keep an eye on aim surplus, they get shipments in often. the lowers they are getting in are from orders placed months ago. you may also be able to backorder one if you call them. when they do show them in stock they will be gone sometimes in 15 min. btw the frenzy began a year ago. "????? ????" "the constitution shall never be construed to prevent the people of the united states who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms." thunderstick novice posts: sent you a pm. they can be had. get some has a shipment coming in tomorrow. i really wish i would have had the resources to get in on that p.c. lower group buy awhile back. anyone interested in parting with theirs? even at a reasonable profit? zacharia sniper posts: i've checked everywhere too, everything is sold out. maybe a couple weeks they'll be some stuff. i was able to find military surpule mags for my ak 47 on midway. i've got a couple of these and they're the best there is, but i'll bet they'll be sold out soon too. at the least, you should be trying to get high cap mags. tiinslc marksman posts: jale.xander on fri 21 dec 2012 9:11 pm i picked up 2 stag lowers today from lan world in bluffdale. they may still have some in stock. "thunderstick? ... you actually said thunderstick? ... that, my friend, is a winchester 30.06." jale.xander marksman posts: paul wrote: i ordered 10 new frontier armory complete lowers yesterday. 3 or 4 for me. 3 have already "sold". that means i have a few more that could be claim. email me if you want the last couple. edit. i have no idea how long they will take to get here. i will take 2 from you. depending on price anyway. this is not a spelling or grammar contest. get over it! gunlvr marksman posts: reddenjeff on fri 21 dec 2012 11:37 pm at 1 gun store i was in today they were selling complete lowers, with basic magpul moe grip and stock, lar lower and dpms lower parts kit for $1,000. people are getting crazy reddenjeff novice posts: can you blame them? if the aw ban gets placed, expect your ar's to have a price trajectory similar to machine guns after they were banned in 86. some of it is speculation, others are just getting theirs while they can. if you know high cap mags are getting banned, its the absolute best 5 or 10 year investment you can make. only one individual can be 100% relied upon to be in your presence at all times and in all places to defend you and your family. bltdonahue on sat 22 dec 2012 1:29 am daeyel wrote: can you blame them? if the aw ban gets placed, expect your ar's to have a price trajectory similar to machine guns after they were banned in 86. some of it is speculation, others are just getting theirs while they can. if you know high cap mags are getting banned, its the absolute best 5 or 10 year investment you can make. pre-ban ars ran about 2x the price of "ban-friendly" ars after the 1994 ban. machine gun prices slowly climbed, but didn't sky-rocket until they were touted around the turn of the century as a safe investment...and then the monied crowd got into it. in any case, i don't expect this recent panic buying to set the new price...it'll simply set the new high-water mark for the next 10 years. there are a lot of gomers out there who just overspent by 30-100% on an ar...and will eventually have to concede they're sitting on a commodity they didn't actual have interest in, and will sell it. the world would be much better off if stupidity caused infertility. bltdonahue sniper posts: reddenjeff on sat 22 dec 2012 9:27 am the funny thing is is to watch the people coming into the store. yesterday a clerk was holding a m+p15 in his hand, cust comes in asking if they have any ar-15 because he needs to buy one. the clerk says that the gun in hand is an ar-15. cust responds, oh so that is what it looks like. so he is convinced needs ar15 when doesn't even know what one looks like. another cust at same store, asked similar question then when shown the ar-15, guy explained basic features of it then cust said i thought they were machine guns and was upset could not fire automatic, although not too upset because still bought it. reddenjeff novice posts: doctor jenks on sat 22 dec 2012 2:57 pm paul wrote: i ordered 10 new frontier armory complete lowers yesterday. 3 or 4 for me. 3 have already "sold". that means i have a few more that could be claim. email me if you want the last couple. edit. i have no idea how long they will take to get here. sent you a pm. i would like one or so of these lowers as well. doctor jenks marksman posts:

C	 mayor: keep 2 ny subway push deaths in perspective - dc breaking local news weather sports fox 5 wttg : new york (ap) - for new york city, it wasn't an unusual sight: a possibly mentally ill woman pacing and mumbling to herself on an elevated subway station platform. the woman eventually took a seat on a bench thursday night, witnesses later said. then, without any warning or provocation, she sprang up and used both hands to shove a man into the path of an oncoming train. as police sought on friday to locate the unidentified woman, mayor michael bloomberg urged residents to keep the second fatal subway shove in the city this month in perspective. the news of the horrific death of 46-year-old sunando sen, who was from india and lived in queens, came as the mayor touted drops in the city's annual homicide and shooting totals. see original work for more on this and other stories.

T	mom, the intern: what i saw at church on sunday.
C	 gratuitous selfie using my new dslr. go on and hate if you must. i didn't notice if any women were wearing pants, but i did notice ... -women offering prayers, both to open and close meetings -a recently-returned female missionary giving a beautiful sermon, with conviction, on being truly converted to the gospel of jesus christ -a woman masterfully playing the organ in sacrament meeting -a woman playing a rather exuberant piano solo of "joy to the world" (that was me, actually) -many women offering insightful, educated comments during class instruction -- women also made up the majority of contributions to the discussion -a teenaged young woman conducting a meeting without assistance -another teenaged young woman providing the piano accompaniment for the hymn -a woman teaching a lesson to the 12- and 13-year-old girls on the importance of discovering and developing talents (also me) -those 12- and 13-year-old girls contributing to the lesson discussion with thoughtful, intelligent comments -a musically-gifted woman leading the choir during choir practice. she also organized a group of 10+ strings players (mostly girls) to accompany the opening hymn next week during our christmas service. -another talented woman accompanying the choir on the piano -yet another musically-talented woman playing an oboe solo with the choir for next week's christmas program -the introduction of new, empowering teaching curriculum for the youth which will involve them -- boys and girls -- teaching portions of the lessons -several 18-year-old young women from my congregation attending a mission preparation class along with some young men from the stake (region) -men, women and children uniting their voices together in song to rejoice in the birth of the savior during our stake christmas choir festival in what ways do you see women contributing to your church congregation's services?

C	the hidden truth of the black slave trade (full) michael hoffman ii and dr. tony martin phew. alright, y'all. here's the deal. there was a particular video that i was searching for; one that you may be familiar with. it featured very young (apparently "hispanic") negros dancing suggestively at a party as their parents cheered them on and even participated. after a thorough search, i finally found the full version. however, in the process i also discovered that this is unfortunately not such an uncommon thing. here's one of several similar videos i found, and i decided on this one - mainly because i really have no idea how to even upload the other considering the site it's hosted on. here's a link. this is all way beyond my comprehension. wtf are... wilhelm furtw?ngler conducting the berlin philharmonic orchestra in a performance of beethoven's symphony no. 9 in d minor op 125. this recording was made in berlin, recorded live 22-24 march, 1942. wilhelm furtw?ngler "adagio from symphony no 7" bruckner from their album "the morrigan's call." lyrics: we are alone in this cursed land, left to die like starving dogs. our crops have failed us yet again; nothing grows in this desolate bog. i hold my daughter in my arms. she is too weak to stand or walk. her face is gaunt, her belly empty; she cannot see, she cannot talk. what money i had has all been spent, on bread and milk and bloody rent. they take from us all that we have, these bastards that from hell were sent. hitler vs. mot?rhead - born to raise hell ode to a dying people by saga www.thisissaga.com eyes shining bright with unspilt tears, thinking about all these wasted years. everything worth living for is gone, brother, i find it hard to keep fighting on. falling down towards the abyss, the reaper embraces me with his kiss; the genocide of the white race, engineered by the international jews. t.j.b. t.n.b. :spic: :nigdrum: hal turner trolls nigger - epic chimpout ensues is deas an sagairt?n ? gr? mo chro?, is nach aoibhinn dhon phobail?n a dt?ann s? tr?d t? s?ala ? mhuire air agus branda ? chr?ost 'gus n?l pabhsae i ng?ird?n mar gr? mo chro? t? an o?che seo dorcha agus t? s? fuar, 'gus t? s? a' goilli?nt ar mo chro? go crua; n? ghabhaidh m? abhaile is n? ghabhadh ar cuairt n? go gcaithfidh m? an o?che am?rach le mo ghr? chois cuain. hal turner totally destroys the 'holocaust' story in 90 seconds german girl in despair, beaten (maybe raped), filmed on a country road after the passage of the red army. condom commercial shows ditzy/skanky blonde with aids infected negro

C	 welcome to nokia support discussions! here you can share advice and tips with thousands of other nokia users around the world in english. many nokia employees also follow and participate in the discussions, see our guidelines for more information. everyone can search and read the discussions, but to post your own question or reply to others, simply my asha 300 on o2 has the capability to use gsm, 3g or both. i have ruled out using both as the phone "chats" all the time as it hunts for the best signal. my phone is used mainly for calls, texts and occasional email checking.

T	gametrailers | forums ? view topic - ea plans on putting microtransactions on all ...
C	 deep down (working title) pop block: debut trailer thu feb 28, 2013 2:17 am time for ea to take a hike. i for one will be boycotting all ea games (even though its not hard) and i hope others gamers will follow. ea is not for gaming. word needs to spread against these f*ckers speaking at the morgan stanley technology, media and telecom conference, ea cfo blake jorgensen outlined the company's plans to expand the controversial strategy. transcription by seeking alpha: "we're building into all of our games the ability to pay for things along the way, either to get to a higher level to buy a new character, to buy a truck, a gun, whatever it might be," he said. pay-to-win doesn't bother me with free games, where the basic business model comes from players coughing up small amounts of cash to juice their characters. but there's something a little unpleasant about including those features in a $60 box game. it tells the gamer that the full retail price isn't enough to be something like a "preferred customer." when i saw the pages of entrancing weapons in dead space 3 that i wasn't going to be able to build without forking over more cash, it made me feel like i was playing an inferior game. "consumers are enjoying and embracing that way of the business," jorgensen added. thu feb 28, 2013 2:34 am doesn't matter. ea never made good games in the first place. thu feb 28, 2013 2:38 am if it's anything like dead space 3, then it's probably not as bad as at seems. the news of microtransactions in dead space 3 was a bit too sensationalized. i'm halfway through the game and the microtransactions haven't been an issue at all. thu feb 28, 2013 2:45 am i genuinely don't remember the last ea title i bought and enjoyed. too bad this isn't going to hurt them one bit. just look at that crap dead space 3, selling like hot cakes despite its low quality. kingduqcisback wrote: if you guys would fiking stop buying shitty costume and shitty dlc and shitty fucking microtransaction shit like that we would get complete game for 60$ not peices of it. pwizz wrote: "consumers are enjoying and embracing that way of the business," jorgensen added. thu feb 28, 2013 4:14 am apparently, it turns out people actually enjoy it. thu feb 28, 2013 4:21 am dead space 3's use of microtransactions is fine. same with mass effect 3. there are only a couple of ways they can do microtransactions in a way that would be worth worrying about: - make the game deliberately more difficult so that you have to pay for weapons or health boosters in order to proceed. - make it so that you have to buy extra lives to continue, or otherwise wait for a period of time to continue playing if you die. both these things were featured in a mobile game called candy crush. i got to a point in the game, after having to wait loads for my lives to reappear, only to realise that i'd need to buy their boosters to get any further. that's fine since i got the game for free anyway. thing is, i was only playing that game to kill time, so having to wait for more lives was counter-productive to that, and i was always playing it at times when i had no internet access, so i couldn't buy the boosters even if i wanted to. but with this whole "get to the next level faster" scheme, i'm reminded of the fact that we used to have such a feature as that for free. it was called cheat codes . you could unlock everything in the game immediately, at the cost of your sense of accomplishment. microtransactions also remove that sense of accomplishment, while charging you for it, but some games like candy crush pretty much require that you use them. if any $60 game ever utilises them in such a way as that, i will definitely boycott such a game. if i type in green, i am joking or being sarcastic. epicbox wrote: dead space 3's use of microtransactions is fine. dead space 3's use of microtransactions is fine. no, it's not. you might think that at first glance but it's hard to shake the feeling that the entire crafting system was designed around them. they completely scrapped ds2's system and went with the most immersion breaking system for a horror game they could. might as well add farm cultivation for the next game and growing tomatoes which then you process at a plant for health potions. even if you don't pay a dime, it still affects your gaming experience which could have been drastically different if not for those transactions. 1. lol horror game. dead space was never a horror game 2. the craftng system is really really good it lets you experiemet a lot and find you the right combination you like.in dead space 3 not one weapon is the one everyone will use but instead you can make every weapon to a killer one. yoshi-egg wrote: doesn't matter. ea never made good games in the first place. i don't like the direction of ea, but to say this is pure ignorance at it's finest. the only games i truly cared about were dead space, battlefield & mass effect. (published majority of them). however, they still make good titles, way better than activision.

T	myjournals.org - science - 'implementation of infection control best practice in intensive care units throughout europe: a mixed-method evaluation study' (implementation science)
C	 implementation of infection control best practice in intensive care units throughout europe: a mixed-method evaluation study (implementation science) 19 february 2013 20:19:42 implementation of infection control best practice in intensive care units throughout europe: a mixed-method evaluation study (implementation science) tweet background: the implementation of evidence-based infection control practices is essential, yet challenging for healthcare institutions worldwide. although acknowledged that implementation success varies with contextual factors, little is known regarding the most critical specific conditions within the complex cultural milieu of varying economic, political, and healthcare systems. given the increasing reliance on unified global schemes to improve patient safety and healthcare effectiveness, research on this topic is needed and timely. the `indepth` work package of the european fp7 prevention of hospital infections by intervention and training (prohibit) consortium aims to assess barriers and facilitators to the successful implementation of catheter-related bloodstream infection (crbsi) prevention in intensive care units (icu) across several european countries. methods: we use a qualitative case study approach in the icus of six purposefully selected acute care hospitals among the 15 participants in the prohibit crbsi intervention study. for sensitizing schemes we apply the theory of diffusion of innovation, published implementation frameworks, sensemaking, and new institutionalism. we conduct interviews with hospital health providers/agents at different organizational levels and ethnographic observations, and conduct rich artifact collection, and photography during two rounds of on-site visits, once before and once one year into the intervention. data analysis is based on grounded theory. given the challenge of different languages and cultures, we enlist the help of local interpreters, allot two days for site visits, and perform triangulation across multiple data sources.qualitative measures of implementation success will consider the longitudinal interaction between the initiative and the institutional context. quantitative outcomes on catheter-related bloodstream infections and performance indicators from another work package of the consortium will produce a final mixed-methods report. conclusion: a mixed-methods study of this scale with longitudinal follow-up is unique in the field of infection control. it highlights the `why` and `how` of best practice implementation, revealing key factors that determine success of a uniform intervention in the context of several varying cultural, economic, political, and medical systems across europe. these new insights will guide future implementation of more tailored and hence more successful infection control programs.trial registration: trial number: prohibit-241928 (fp7 reference number) 6 views category: general , medicine developing program theory for purveyor programs (implementation science) the articles that are most similar to this article 7.81 19-02-2013 14:04:18 developing program theory for purveyor programs (implementation science) blog comments powered by disqus

T	cup's black student union hosts sex games
C	 in these days leading up to valentine's day, clarion university campus has turned into a match-maker game show, provided playing grounds for a condom scavenger hunt, and hosted to multiple guest speakers who encouraged the awareness of safe sex. the black student union of clarion university hosted a week of special events starting feb. 4 in preparation for valentine's day. bsu has sponsored these valentine-themed events for over 10 years now, and each year attracts a wide range of participants. the bsu valentine's events commenced monday, feb. 4 with a presentation from lisa defranco from the north west aids alliance group. it's not the first time defranco has presented for cu students, her presentation included demonstrating to the audience the proper way to use condoms, as well as the video "hiv in black america." nbc's singing competition "the voice" season two contestant jamar rogers spoke on tuesday, feb. 5 on behalf of hiv awareness and his struggles with being hiv positive. the singer spoke to a crowd of about 450 people in the gemmell student complex multi-purpose room, filling the room to capacity. defranco was actually the first to contact rogers, inquiring about a visit to clarion, and worked with bsu president derek parker putting the event together. defranco had messaged rogers directly through his facebook page, and by chance rogers replied shortly after. "he gets thousands of facebook messages a day, and he just happened to see the message lisa defranco sent him and actually replied," parker said. "he made a point to talk to everyone at his show. he answered everyone's questions before and after the show, and took pictures with everyone. he's definitely both a talented and cool person." rogers joined parker and other members of bsu after the event for dinner at applebee's where the conversation continued, and rogers announced he would be happy to come back to clarion. "i hope that if i ever run across another celebrity that [he/she's] as down to earth as jamar," said parker. "his show, as well as meeting and going out to dinner with him, was definitely the highlight of the week for me." wednesday's event featured another guest speaker, phebe west of harrisburg. west spoke about each sexually transmitted disease, how they can be contracted, as well as how they can be prevented. pamphlets were presented to spread awareness, and pictures representing the diseases were shared in a slideshow to press the necessity of this awareness. the popular 'safe sex scavenger hunt' was held thursday, feb. 7 in the stc building on campus. "basically we had condoms hidden all over the first floor of the stc building," said parker. "contestants were put into teams, and the two teams who found the most condoms went to the next round." during this round, each member of the two remaining teams was asked a question relating to knowledge gathered over the course of the week. those who answered correctly were sent on to the next round, where they were blindfolded and instructed to put a condom on a banana. senior kiara brown accomplished the task the fastest, winning a gift bag of goodies relating to valentine's day such as candy, a stuffed animal and flowers. the valentine's day game show was held friday night in the gemmell student complex, hosted by mark ferguson, and was conducted in the way of a dating game show such as "love connection." contestants were chosen randomly from the audience, blindfolded and asked questions regarding their ideal relationship. winners received a gift bag of candy, a stuffed animal and flowers.

T	silver: the new gold? an infographic - munknee.com | munknee.com
C	editor silver: the new gold? an infographic while gold remains a smart move, there's much to be said for silver. why? because, unlike gold, silver has an inherent value that goes well beyond scarcity. without silver the world as we know it would literally stop. the computer screen on which you are reading these words, has silver in it. the tv you watch, has silver in it?and the list goes on and on. so says an introduction to a post* from entitled infographic: is silver the new gold created by the silver bomb. this post is presented compliments of www.financialarticlesummariestoday.com (a site for sore eyes and inquisitive minds), it's free - sign up here) and may have been edited ([ ]), abridged (?) and/or reformatted (some sub-titles and bold/italics emphases) for the sake of clarity and brevity to ensure a fast and easy read. please note that this paragraph must be included in any article re-posting to avoid copyright infringement. the post goes on to say: this infographic was created?[by michael macdonald co-author of "the silver bomb: beyond the return of metal as money" to explore why some investing experts believe that silver's price may soon outpace gold]. with silver supplies dwindling and demand on an upward spiral, there seems to be no end to silver's meteoric rise in value. courtesy of the authors of the book the silver bomb (click on the link to read a free preview of the book or to order the e-book right away). the author's views and conclusions in the above article are unaltered and no personal comments have been included to maintain the integrity of the original post. furthermore, the views, conclusions and any recommendations offered in this article are not to be construed as an endorsement of such by the editor. * (? 2013 gold silver worlds. all rights reserved.) and we can establish your products there - we've already done it for others chinese market is 4x bigger than those of the u.s. and canada combined - pollution treatment/prevention equipment (water & air), disease detection/treatments (diabetes & cancers), - green energy products (heating & power). silver has had double digit gains in 7 of the last 10 years. in this infographic, we look at the investment properties of silver as well as its chief differences with gold. highlights include a study on silver correlation, volatility, performance against the us dollar and money supply, and portfolio diversification. of the 1040.6 million troy oz of silver produced in 2011, 84% was used in over 10,000 modern industrial applications (16% used as an investment) of which approx. 33% was used in the traditional forms of fabrication such as jewelry, coins, medals, and silverware with the remaining 66% actually being consumed. while the actual amount is unknown, some experts believe as much as 90-95% of all the silver ever mined has been 'lost' to landfills. for this reason, there is likely less silver available above ground than gold (98% of all gold is accounted for today). for more interesting information regarding the supply of, and demand for, silver please refer to the infographic below. silver has thousands of industrial uses and is considered a store of wealth by investors. the infographic below illustrates silver's history as a currency in the past and as an essential component in industry and technology today. silver: another decade of 500% returns is very possible - here's why silver has given returns of 584% in the last ten years and this article discusses the reasons for believing that silver can produce another decade of over 500% returns. words: 954; charts: 7 availability of, and demand for, silver vs. gold suggests much higher future prices for silver the current availability ratio of physical silver to gold for investment purposes is approximately 3:1. so, why is it that investors are allocating their dollars to silver at a much higher ratio? what is it that these "smart" investors understand? let's have a look at the numbers and see if it's time for investors to do as a wise man once said and "follow the money." words: 1052; tables: 1 silver: 5 forces that should help polish off the tarnish & propel it higher the price of silver has been corroding for much of the past year but a variety of signals in recent months suggest that it may not be long before silver begins to shine once again. [this article identifies 5 such signals and/or reasons why that may well be the case.] words: 643; charts: 2 20 reasons why a significant % of your investment portfolio should be in silver i believe that silver could go to $60 per troy ounce by the end of 2014?.i also believe silver will be the best single investment of this decade. the following article is focused on why i think you should seriously consider having a significant percentage of your investment portfolio in silver. words: 1600 the price of silver is going to go much, much higher - much higher - over the next decade [relative to gold according to jim rogers and i concur. below are 5 solid reasons why i believe that is the case.] words: 767 gold:silver ratio suggests much higher price of silver in next few years the majority of analysts are now of the opinion that gold will reach a parabolic peak price somewhere in excess of $5,000 per troy ounce in the next few years. given the fact that the historical movement of silver is 90 - 95% correlated with that of gold suggests that a much higher price for silver can also be anticipated. couple that with the fact that silver is currently greatly undervalued relative to its average long-term historical relationship with gold, silver could escalate dramatically in price over the next few years. how much? this article takes a look at historical gold:silver ratios and what attaining certain relationships would mean for the price of silver should specific price levels for gold be realized. words: 691 personally, based on the fundamentals at hand and the fact that gold doubled its log channel around this point in the cycle; i expect silver to bust up out of its log channel in 2013. initially, i look for silver to reach the $60 to $68 level, first and hold open the possibility for silver to do much more on the upside as the 70's silver chart reflects. alf field sees silver reaching $158.34 based on his $4,500 gold projection! this article was prompted by a question enquiring what the silver price might be if my gold forecast of $4,500 proved to be correct [see my article entitled "alf field: correction in gold is over and on way to $4,500+!" and i have settled on] a target price of $158.34 for silver. [let me explain how i came to that specific price.] the value of silver has skyrocketed in recent decades -leading many investing experts to believe that silver's price could outpace gold for the first time in history. this infographic covers silver's meteoric increase and the factors that have led to silver's exploding value?[and] takes a nod to the future to see where silver's price may be headed based on the most up to date demand data. it's true that there are "no sure things" in life?but an investment in silver comes darn close! yes, you'll have to ride the tidal wave of price manipulation but when the waves die down you will fully appreciate the power and value of silver. let me explain. moolman: long-term chart suggests silver will comfortably pass $150 by end of 2013 thanks to this similarity in events, as well as the similarity in sequence, of the price movement of silver from the beginning of 1966 to the beginning of 1980 with the end of 1999 to the end 2013, my analysis suggests that silver will comfortably pass $150 by that date. let me explain my rationale. words: 338 silver will go to $50 and then explode dramatically higher! here's why there is a massive amount of energy underlying the silver market, and when it is ready to unleash, we will see price/value increases that will stun even the most ardent silverbugs?the real power of this expected move is likely to be released only some time after the price of silver has surpassed the $50/ozt. level. [let me explain.] words: 685 psychologists tell us that there are five stages of grief over loss of whatever kind, usually death, or breaking up with a loved one, which are: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance. i've applied these to the loss of the dollar, as i see most people today are still stuck in denial, and here's how to deal with that. words: 1100 david morgan: gold to go up 10-20% in 2013; silver by a good 30% according to david morgan 2013 will be a bullish year in which a new leg up will start with gold going up 10% to 20% and silver a good 30%. that leg up is starting right now, although we probably will not see a substantial acceleration in the leg up like we saw in the first part of 2011 but, obviously, as soon as $50 is crossed an acceleration can be expected. [morgan explains his position in article excerpts below.] words: 912 silver projected to reach $100/ozt. as soon as late 2015! here's my rationale there are many predictions for the price of silver. some say it will crash to nearly $20, and others proclaim $100 by the end of 2012. the problem is that some predictions are only wishful thinking, others are obvious disinformation designed to scare investors away from silver, and many are not grounded in hard data and clear analysis. other analyses are excellent, but both the processes and analyses are difficult to understand. is there an objective and rational method to project a future silver price that will make sense to most people? yes, there is! [and here it is!] words: 1071 i believe there is more opportunity in the silver market over the next two years relative to gold and, as such i'm now advocating accumulating a large overweight position in silver relative to gold because, over the long-term, there is such a great demand vs. supply situation developing?.before investing in silver, however, there are a number very important things that you must understand about the silver market. let me explain. words: 899 the top 10 silver producing countries & companies - and investment options 2013 will go down in history as the best buying opportunity for gold & silver metals and stocks - ever! market signals, commodity trends, economic indicators & related news short url: investing. you can follow any responses to this entry through the rss 2.0 . you can leave a response or trackback to this entry comments to post a comment, you must login using facebook, yahoo, aol, or hotmail in the box below. have an under-performing employee? here are 32 priceless evaluation quips to quote time the market with these market strength & volatility indicators munknee.com: "internet's most unique site for financial articles" - here's why sinclair: silver's rise will be orgasmic; gold is a buy below $3,500 attn. bank depositors: what happened in cyprus could never possibly happen in the u.s. - really? stock market warning! the greedometer's 6 previous forecasts were bang on - here's their 7th pan-global financial collapse may be close at hand due to banking crisis in cyprus seniord: good article, most people don't realize that two different debts and therefore are... seniord: and it allows you to leave comments so others can consider your viewpoint! a must read each day? disclosure: it is our intent that all posts on this site be in accordance with the requirements, restrictions and terms of the copyright law of the united states and all other copyright treaties to which the united states is party and more specifically of the library of congress catalog as to their eligibility for posting. should any post be deemed to be inadvertently in contravention of these acts' terms please advise with substantiation of such apparent contravention (i.e. registration number) and the article in question will be immediately deleted from the site. also, visit fair use notice: this site contains copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner. we are making such material available in our efforts to advance understanding of financial, economic and investment issues, etc. we believe this constitutes a 'fair use' of any such copyrighted material as provided for in section 107 of the us copyright law. in accordance with title 17 u.s.c. section 107, the material on this site is distributed without profit to those who have expressed a prior interest in receiving the included information for research and educational purposes. if you wish to use copyrighted material from this site for purposes of your own that go beyond 'fair use', you must obtain permission from the copyright owner.

"i'm struggling to see the angles on every shot. i nicked a few frames against john and luckily for me he didn't play well, although he played better than i did and probably deserved to win. "the only frame i felt good in was the last one. i won a big frame to go 3-2, i made a good clearance because it was last-chance saloon. if it had been 4-1 i couldn't have won." milkins threw his cue on to the floor during the eighth frame. "it was just pure frustration," he said. "i've been playing so badly it's unbelievable, i don't feel like a professional at the moment. sometimes we let our emotions out. "maybe i shouldn't have done it so i apologise to john but it hurts me when i play like that." ebdon's defence of his crown came to an early end with a 5-3 loss to marcus campbell, whose opponent in the last-16 will be fellow scotsman graeme dott. sky and our business partners may use your information to contact you about products and services you may like. by pressing submit you are indicating your agreement to this unless you tick the box to opt out. china open results all the results from the bank of beijing china open held at beijing university students' gymnasium. history maker new world number one tiger woods won't be content until he breaks more records, says denis pugh. brits abroad former newcastle player ray hudson discusses his time in fort lauderdale with george best. tiger woods competition win a luxury gleneagles break with tiger woods pga tour 14 wolf creek challenge play this awesome new course in our great free golf game! sky sports pub finder sky has launched a pub finder for eager fans wanting to find a venue to watch sky sports. sky sports living for sport get a sports star to visit your old secondary school as part of our free schools initiative.

C	raffles institution rugby player in icu after collapse during training social health in singapore is on the decline in five key domains: family, healthcare, housing and transport, income security and individual well-being. four men injured, 3 persons missing after shipyard fire in jurong chelsea as his greatest ever achievement. the 35-year-old netted a late equaliser and the shootout-winning penalty against bayern munich in last year's final, as the west london club defied the odds to lift the trophy for the first time in their history. and, ahead of participating in the quarter-finals with current club galatasaray, drogba has revealed that the events of may 19 2012 outstrip anything else he has experienced. "i didn't expect to be back in the champions league," he told galatasaray are 100/1 to win the champions league with william hill "last season i finally lifted the champions league trophy, my last season with chelsea was the peak of my career." the ivory coast international initially joined chinese side shanghai shenhua after leaving stamford bridge, but quickly returned to europe with gala following a dispute over wages. and he has underlined his happiness at the turkish club, adding: "life is great here. it's a cosmopolitan city, it's a lovely place and culturally it's a very nice place for my family to be. "i'm here to play football at the highest level again, the club are well established in europe, they have won the uefa cup in the past and are trying to take it to the next level." netherlands star wesley sneijder arrived at galatasaray just days before drogba, but the ivorian insists the pair are still some way from their best. "our transfers got an amazing reception," he added. "we are trying to live up to what is expected from us. galatasaray must make champions league sacrifice to win league, insists ? coe prices for small cars end lower, premiums up for other categories certificate of entitlement (coe) premiums for small cars closed lower in the latest bidding exercise on wednesday, while that of big cars shot up. this brings price levels back to normal in a way after ? former ntuc income consultants take union to court over new contracts one year after ntuc income "reclassified" its 660-strong army of consultants as "agents", some of those affected are taking the company to court. namely, they say they were not given the information they ? north korea's military put its "strategic" rocket units on a war footing tuesday, with a fresh threat to strike targets on the us mainland, hawaii and guam, as well as south korea. drogba: champions league win with chelsea was the peak of my career barcelona, bayern munich, juventus & manchester united - why the ancien regime rules europe future news: u.s. to hold victory parade after scoreless draw in mexico francesco totti struggles to speak english, earns gigi buffon's admiration

T	cele|bitchy ? blog archive ? is 'cripplingly lonely' taylor swift reaching out to her ex-boyfriend conor kennedy?
C	is 'cripplingly lonely' taylor swift reaching out to her ex-boyfriend conor kennedy? here are some new photos of taylor swift exiting her nyc hotel yesterday, on her way to a concert in new jersey. i would just like to take a moment and praise swifty? i know, i'm not usually the person to see for pro-swifty senitments, but here we go. i like that she's been keeping her head down since the anti-swifty backlash following a justin bieber-like meltdown . whatever negative stuff you can throw at swifty, she actually has pretty decent pr instincts, and she knows when to back away and let her image have a "rest". swifty keeps her pr image tight, and that's admirable in someone so young, i think. ok, nice moment over. do you realize that swifty has been without an official boyfriend for three months? it's been so long! yeah, she might be boning that blonde surfer dude, but nothing is "official" until swifty does a cutesy photo-op with the guy. so in her hour of loneliness and need, is it crazy that she would reach out to an ex? what if that ex was conor kennedy? are taylor swift and conor kennedy headed for a reunion? it might be so! harry styles can rest easy, but taylor may "never, ever" want to get back together with him, but she might feel differently about conor! since her split from harry earlier this year, taylor has been suffering from "crippling loneliness" that conor has been helping her through. are they getting back together? conor, 18, has been a real shoulder for taylor, 23 to cry on in recent months, as not only has she suffered another break up, she is being teased mercilessly for dating so many guys. "conor has been a real source of comfort to taylor recently. she is suffering from crippling loneliness," a source tells grazia magazine. however, don't be hoping for a reunion between taylor and robert kennedy's grandson just yet. "they get on really well, but it was just a fleeting romance. she loves that he listens to her worries and he has been a real crutch. he's the most down-to-earth person she's dated." taylor and conor have a real bond, as she has been there for him in tough times also. she was a real rock for him following his mother's suicide in 2012. [from hollywood life] yeah, this originally came from grazia, so it's not the most reliable thing in the world. but i do think swifty would consider an 18-year-old kennedy boy "down-to-earth". or that in her mind, she's got real problems and she needs to vent on an 18-year-old who lost his mother a year ago. but other than that? i think this might be possible. i never really thought conor and taylor's love story was over last year. i always believed they would eventually get back together. maybe they'll see each other during conor's spring break? or maybe they'll get back together for his summer break (before he goes back to prep school for his senior year in 2013-2014). david beckham out with harper seven elle macpherson's huge engagement ring [popsugar] splash recap, are people watching this? [grantland] march 28, 2013 at 10:01 am it's becoming more and more common for parents to start their kids (especially boys) late in kindergarten, to give them an advantage. sometimes there a reason, usually it's just more of this "build the uber-child super self esteem parenting" bs! march 28, 2013 at 9:56 am i find it weird that she's so into teenage boys. it's not the fact that there's an age difference. if she was a 30r old dating a 25yr old, cool, but what 23yr old woman chases after 18yr old boys? maturity wise, that's a big, big gap, especially for a woman like her who has probably had a marriage/ babies deadline set since she was a litle girl. does she really think a kid a few months out of school is going to sweep her off her feet? march 28, 2013 at 10:10 am i've never noticed before, does she always wear hideous shoes? click here to cancel reply. celebitchy aims to be a friendly, welcoming site where people can discuss entertainment stories and current events in a lighthearted, safe environment without fear of harassment, excessive negativity, or bullying. different opinions, backgrounds, ages, and nationalities are welcome here - hatred and bigotry are not. if you make racist or bigoted remarks, comment under multiple names, or wish death on anyone you will be banned. there are no second chances if you violate one of these basic rules. use the "report this comment as spam or abuse" link to ask the moderators to delete a comment if it's offensive. if your comment disappears, it may have been eaten by the spam filter. please e-mail cbcomments at gmail.com to get it retrieved.

T	the three types of listings available to tour in the portland metro rmls area
C	 the three types of listings available to tour in the portland metro rmls area the three types of listings available to tour in the portland metro rmls area this post was inspired by bill lauder's recent (members only) post: what is the rationale of showing a property under contract? as with all things real estate, it's all local. in my local market our multiple listing service is the rmls. they have set rules, everything from who can become a member to how to input data correctly into the listing sheet. from the rules we have various status settings for a given listing: can = canceled exp = expired sld = sold of the various status of a listing, there are only three that we can legitimitely show . . . active, short sale pending and bumpable buyers. in bill's post and with the following comments, it seems that showing a pending property is kosher in some areas. that may be, as all things real estate are local. but, if the property is pending here in my local market, the rmls has rules that state it's not an available listing to show to buyers. people get very confused with the ssp status. yes, it's a short sale and it's "pending" the lender(s) final approval. yes, it can be shown, but in most cases, the offer is already mutually agreed to by buyer and seller and submitted. only offers in back-up will be taken. an offer coming in on a ssp won't bounce the offer in first position. eba portland ~~ 100% buyer representation ~~ 100% of the time carla muss-jacobs - principal broker/ owner | exclusive buyers agent | more about me? 503-810-7192 | buyersagentportland.com beaverton or, portland or, forest heights, lake oswego, hillsboro, sw portland, se portland, nw portland, n portland, downtown, the pearl, ne portland, milwaukie, west linn, aloha, cedar hills, portland, or eba portland, llc an exclusive buyer agency representing buyers in the portland metro real estate market since 1999. the sellers have their own agent ~~ why don't you have yours? carla muss-jacobs practices the true form of buyer agency ~~ exclusive buyer agent . her office/brokerage never takes listings and never respresents the seller. exclusive buyer agency is the best form of legal real estate representation a buyer can have disclaimer: activerain corp. does not necessarily endorse the real estate agents, loan officers and brokers listed on this site. these real estate profiles,

T	china dissident's brother says home attacked nightly with dead poultry, bottles | reuters
C	 beijing (reuters) - security personnel in eastern china are carrying out a nightly harassment campaign against the brother of blind rights activist chen guangcheng, the two said on tuesday, throwing rocks, bottles and dead poultry at his house for 12 nights in a row. the attacks on the village home of chen guangfu continued early on tuesday, he said. two cars parked outside his house in shandong province, shining their headlights through the windows and again security personnel threw rocks and beer bottles at the house and into the yard, he said. "this is a country of hoodlums, not a country of law," chen guangcheng said of china from new york, where he is studying law at new york university. "if you have principles, if you do what is right, why are you afraid of people?" he said. "why do these kinds of things in the middle of the night? what kind of person does this? only thieves and the narrow-minded, spreading unchecked. but that's how the communist party is now." chen guangcheng made world headlines last year when he escaped house arrest and spent 20 hours on the run alone before meeting up with supporters who helped get him to beijing where he was given refuge at the u.s. embassy. his escape caused a diplomatic tussle with the united states at a time when then-u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton was visiting beijing. he was then allowed permission to go to the united states to study. chen guangfu, 56, said the attacks started on april 18, the same day his brother had been put on a village communist party blacklist for his plans to visit taiwan and, the party said, tibet. "they said he's planning to go to taiwan to work on taiwan independence, and to go to tibet to support tibet independence," chen said. china claims self-ruled taiwan as its own and insists on eventual unification, by force if necessary. chen guangcheng has not said he would try to visit restive tibet, which china has ruled with an iron hand since 1950. chen, who campaigned for citizens' rights including against forced sterilisations in china and who received a human rights award in the united states in january, has accepted an invitation to visit taiwan in june. reached in at his home in dongshigu village, chen guangfu said the security personnel arrived just after 2 a.m. on tuesday, around the same time they had been arriving since april 18. "they don't speak, they just do this," he said.

T	iclichfield - strike-hit lufthansa axes flights
C	german airline lufthansa has cancelled dozens of flights to and from the uk and ireland on monday due to strike action. around 100 flights - including departures and arrivals - have been cancelled at airports in london, manchester, birmingham, newcastle, glasgow, aberdeen, edinburgh and dublin. the german airports affected by the strike are frankfurt, munich, dusseldorf and hamburg. the one-day strike, which is due to a pay dispute, will result in only about 20 of more than 1,650 scheduled short-haul flights operating. passengers affected by the cancellations can re-book for free, lufthansa said. the ver.di trade union announced the one-day "warning strike" - a tactic commonly used by german unions to raise pressure in wage talks - on friday. last wednesday, lufthansa rejected the union's demand for wage increases of 5.2% over the next year as well as job guarantees. © 2013 owned by or licensed to trinity mirror midlands limited.

T	abb to design and deliver the world's largest hoisting systems
C	 abb mine hoist technology is selected for bhp billiton's jansen potash project in canada montreal, april 12, 2013 /cnw telbec/ - abb, the leading power and automation technology group, has been selected by bhp billiton to supply mine hoisting systems for the jansen potash project, located 130 kilometers east of saskatoon, in the province of saskatchewan, canada. the contract includes the overall design, manufacturing, supply and installation of four complete mine hoist systems to be delivered over a period between 2015 and 2018. this includes mechanical components as well as the electrical systems including acs6000 ac drive systems and the high-power, low-speed synchronous motors. globally, abb is the only supplier of complete integrated mine hoisting systems including all mechanical and electrical systems. the massive six meters diameter friction hoists to be supplied for the production shaft will be the largest mine hoists ever designed and manufactured, each with a total connected motor power of close to 14000kw. equally impressive are the service shaft hoists which are electrically identical to the production hoists but will carry smaller payloads. the complexity and ultrahigh performance requirements of the brake systems on these massive hoisting systems requires the development of new mine hoist brake system technology. "we are pleased to have been selected by bhp billiton for the jansen potash project hoist contract," says gabe azeroual, vice president for abb's process automation business in canada. "we believe our leading global position in the design, supply and installation of high-performance mine hoisting systems in high-production mines, as well as our impressive job site safety record will play an important role on the project." once the four hoisting systems at the bhp billiton jansen mine are installed, abb will have an impressive installed base of eleven complete friction hoisting systems, in the province of saskatchewan. in the area of underground mining the company has supplied over 700 mine hoist and automation projects and over 100 stand-alone hoist brake system projects, in more than 30 countries worldwide. abb (www.abb.com) is a leader in power and automation technologies that enable utility and industry customers to improve their performance while lowering environmental impact. the abb group of companies operates in around 100 countries and employs about 145,000 people. in canada, (www.abb.ca) employs about 3,000 people in more than 45 centers from coast to coast. for help with any technical terms in this release, please go to: www.abb.com/glossary. director of communications st-laurent, quebec canada tel: 514-687-4779 mobile: 514-206-4852 yahoo! inc.

T	I Should Be Laughing : Random Musings
F	I Should Be Laughing: Random Musings
C	Oh dear . JCPenney has a new billboard advertising a designer tea kettle that has left many California motorists seeing , well , Nazis . It seems that , to some , myself included , the Michael Graves-designed kettle looks a little like Adolf Hitler with right hand extended outward in the infamous Nazi salute . ? ? I 'm a little Hitler , short and stout ... . ? ? C'mon , you were goin ' there , too ! A little update on the Kaitlyn Hunt story . It appears that I , as well as other bloggers , and the mainstream/lamestream media , got the story , or at least , some of the facts wrong . So , to update : Kaitlyn Hunt is a Lesbian who had a consensual affair with a fellow Lesbian student at their high school . But , contrary to initial reports , Kaitlyn was already 18 when the relationship began , and not , as some , myself included , arrested the moment she turned eighteen a few months later . Does it make a difference , though ? Not really . I mean , if a high school Senior boy dates a Freshman girl , and they have a sexual relationship , how often are the police called ? How often is that boy arrested ? How often is he expelled ? The fact is that Kaitlyn and this unnamed girl were in school together , played on the basketball team together , and just because they had a sexual relationship does not mean that Kaitlyn is a sexual predator and should go to jail for fifteen years . This is not the case of an adult , a legal , out of high school , adult , having an affair with a high school student . She does n't deserve the punishment she 's facing or the vitriol she 's experiencing . Out there round Nevada way , the state Assembly passed a final vote on a constitutional amendment that would send same-sex marriage to the ballot in 2016 . The Senate Joint Resolution 13 passed the Assembly on a 27-14 vote , bringing the process to get it to the ballot in 2016 to an end for this year . Naturally , all the no votes were Republicans and just one lone Republican , Assemblywoman Michele Fiore voted with Democrats . Nevada is on the move y' all . It 's still a couple of years out , but they are on the move . I absolutely love this story . The Citizens ' Stamp Advisory Committee , an advisory panel tasked with determining whom , or what , to commemorate with U.S. postage stamps is said to be considering the late gay Supervisor Harvey Milk for such an honor . The group has contacted Milk 's family to gather more information about the San Francisco politician , who , back in November 1977 , was the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in a major U.S. city . Milk , as we all know , was murdered by Dan White a year later , along with then-Mayor George Moscone . The committee also notified the Harvey Milk National Stamp Campaign that it was looking at issuing a Milk stamp at some point . Milk 's openly gay nephew , Stuart Milk , says his family has been asked by postal officials about upcoming significant milestones that the issuance of a Milk stamp could commemorate . November 8 , 2012 would mark the 35th anniversary of Milk 's historic electoral win , while May 22 , 2015 would coincide with Milk 's 85th birthday . I say just pick a date and let me buy that stamp ! This kills me ; in a high larious way . Last week California released its rates for the Affordable Care Act [ ACA ] , aka `` Obamacare '' and guess what ? The rates are lower , cheaper , and less costly , however you wanna say it , than the Congressional Budget Office 's original 2009 estimates . Take that GOP . And , not only are the rates cheaper , but the ACA looks like it 's doing exactly what they said it would , by creating competition to make health insurance rates more competitive . You . Do n't . Say . And now , while traditional-read `` conservative states '' - have done everything possible to sabotage the ACA , more and more states like Oregon , Washington , and California are proving that the law is performing better than all those naysayers-read `` GOP asshats-previously said . It 's pathetic that millions of Americans living in these Republican controlled Red States will have to suffer without health care coverage , and many die due to a lack of treatment , just because conservative politicians would rather play partisan politics than just admit the truth . And while we all rejoice in the news that Michele Bachmann wo n't seek re-election , there is still that little Ethics probe thingy to deal with . Bachmann , never one to lie ... I kid , she lies every time she speaks ... says her decision to flee like Mama Grizzly Bore ? has nothing to do with that ongoing ethics investigation into misconduct during her 2012 presidential campaign : `` It was clearly understood that compliance with all rules and regulations was an absolute necessity for my presidential campaign . And I have no reason to believe that that was not the case . '' Liar Liar yada yada yada . Hey Michigan ? What 's new ? Well , this week , Democrats in the Michigan state Senate introduced a bill to repeal the constitutional ban on same-sex marriage . The m easure needs two-thirds support in the Republican-led House and Senate to make the statewide ballot , so it 's an uphill battle . But , in addition to that bill , another that would recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages in Michigan was also introduced . A recent poll shows that 56 % of Michigan voters support some form of relationship recognition for same-sex couples . Michigan is on the move , too . FUNNY OF THE WEEK Read that first headline and then follow up with the other . Oh , someone needs to be watched down there in the layout room . Blatantly stolen from BosGuy . HOT MEN OF THE WEEK On top , photographically speaking , Tom Hiddleston . I have no idea who is or what he 's been in , but I came across this picture from Cannes and I was intrigued . Charlie Carrick , in the middle , played Pascal , Micheletto 's spy-lover on The Borgia 's . There he wears a beard and looks delicious . On the bottom , also photographically speaking , Oscar Isaac , whom I saw in a Channing Tatum movie , Ten Years - which sadly had no Tatum ass shots . But it had Oscar , who was the best thing , eye-candy wise , and acting wise , in the movie . A trifecta of film and TV hunkdom . You 're welcome . I do n't shop at WalMart because they treat their employees like crap and , while they profess to be oh-so-patriotic , most of their merchandise is made Not-In-America . So , that 's why I love this bitchslap that Wally got this week . The mega-store has agreed to pay an $ 82 million fine for improper disposal of hazard wastes such as fertilizer and bleach in cases filed in California and Missouri . As part of the California plea agreement , Wal-Mart must a $ 40 million criminal fine and an additional $ 20 million to fund community service projects including helping U.S. retailers learn how to properly handle hazardous waste ; something WalMart does n't , or did n't , do . As part of the Missouri plea agreement , Wal-Mart must $ 11 million criminal fine and an additional $ 3 million to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources . Wal-Mart also must pay a $ 7.628 million civil penalty to the federal government . Ouch . More on Bachmann . As she heads toward obscurity , or a place on FoxNews , which is really the same thing , House Speaker John Boehner , boner , Tweeted his goodbye and his appreciation for all she 's done . So let 's take a look at what she did , shall we ? She sponsored 58 bills . Of those , 53 were referred to committee , AKA they went nowhere One , HR 850 , which was to facilitate a proposed project on the Lower St. Croix Wild and Scenic River , made it out of committee . Three [ HR 373 , which expressed support for the creation of a National Hydrocephalous Awareness Month ; HR 923 , which recognized Minnesota 's 150 th anniversary , and HR 789 , which honored public child welfare agencies ] were agreed to . One [ HR 45 , which sought to repeal the Affordable Healthcare Act ] passed the House . None . Zip . Zero . Nada . Were signed into law . So , to sum up : eight years and she did jackshit . And Boner , er , Boehner , applauds her . Asshat-to-asshat . TWEET OF THE WEEK A JC Penney Tweet in response to Hitler-gate . I gotta give it to them for having a sense of humor , though .

C	NEW YORK ( AP ) - A New York City judge has found the government can go ahead with its plan to make the morning-after pill available over the counter . But Judge Edward Korman also warned the Food and Drug Administration must approve the sales without delay or face further litigation in a long-running dispute over the emergency contraceptives . The memo issued by the judge on Wednesday came in response to a Department of Justice decision this week to reverse course and comply with his order to make morning-after pills available to buyers of any age without prescriptions . Lawyers for women 's rights advocates had argued in a letter to the judge the plan falls short because it limits the unrestricted sales to the more expensive Plan B one-pill version of the drug . The judge wrote approval of the one-pill version `` is sufficient to comply '' with his order .

C	By CHRISTINA A. CASSIDY Associated Press ATLANTA-The video game Jacob Asofsky is creating is simple : `` Someone who is trying to take over the world and you try to stop them . '' The 12-year-old from Florida is spending two weeks at a summer camp in a program that teaches programming skills to young people . `` It 's about having fun , but it also gives them the tools to be able to do this at home because they do n't have this in school , '' said Taylor Jones , director of the iD Tech Camp at Atlanta 's Emory University . So-called coding camps for children are becoming more popular amid a growing effort to expand access to computer programming and inspire more youths to seek computer science degrees and careers in technology . Their rise underscores a seeming mismatch in the U.S. economy : people like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tumblr founder David Karp illustrate the opportunities programming skills can create , yet universities are not graduating enough code-savvy students to meet employers ' demands . The iD Tech Camps , which have grown from 200 students in 1999 to 28,000 enrolled this year in courses at dozens of locations nationwide , use interest in gaming to build bridges to computer programing and hopefully careers in web developing , film animation and app creation for smart phones . Courses start at $ 829 for a one-week course during the day with overnight students paying $ 1,348 . On a recent weekday , Asofsky was attending an iD Tech Camp on the campus with some 95 other youths under the age of 17 . He was using the gaming software RPG Maker to create a video game in which the main character travels around the world , buys animals and armor and interacts with others along the way . `` I have to say the interface of actually making a game is just as fun as playing a game , '' Asofsky said . `` It 's a lot like playing a game inside a game . '' Early courses for children starting at age 7 use the photo and illustration software Adobe Photoshop and the gaming software Multimedia Fusion to create a simple arcade-style game . `` We sit down and talk about what makes games fun , '' said instructor Melissa Andrews , who was working with the youngest group of campers . `` We get it down to the basics so they can make their own game . '' Courses for older children include designing apps , creating sophisticated , 3-D , first-person shooter games using the Unreal Developer 's Kit-also known as UDK-and learning programming languages like Java and C + + . The idea is to build self-confidence and spark interest in learning how computers work , all to perhaps plant the seed of a future career in programming . There will be 1.4 million computing jobs by 2020 but only 400,000 computer science students by that time , according to Code.org , a nonprofit with a list of who 's who in the tech world on its advisory board including Twitter creator Jack Dorsey and Dropbox CEO Drew Houston . And such jobs pay well . The median annual wage for a computer programmer , for instance , was $ 71,380 in 2010 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Meanwhile , jobs for network and computer systems administrators are growing at double the national average , with a median annual salary of $ 69,160 . Yet high schools and universities seem to be out of step with the job market . Nine out of 10 high schools do n't offer computer programming classes and the number of students graduating from college with a computer science degree is down from a decade ago , according to Code.org . Earlier this year , President Barack Obama said programming should be a required course in high school , similar to foreign language requirements . `` Given how pervasive computers and the internet is now and how integral it is into our economy and how fascinated kids are with it , I want to make sure they know how to actually produce stuff using computers and not just simply consume stuff , '' Obama said during a Google + Hangout . Yale Oseroff 's high school back in Virginia does n't offer programming classes . The 17-year-old is spending his fourth year at an iD Tech Camp working through C + + , a popular programming language used for systems and application software , for drivers to communicate between an operating system and devices like printers and to create some video games . `` I 'm learning ( computer ) networking , which is what I want to do in college , '' he said , as he worked on developing a program to capture usernames and passwords and store them in a database . On the Georgia Tech campus , the Institute for Computing Education offers a variety of camps clustered into elementary , middle and high school groups . Courses include making apps with App Inventor , creating moving sculptures with the WeDo Robotics systems that uses rotational motion and creating animations using Alice software . Barbara Ericson , director of computer outreach at the Institute for Computing Education at Georgia Tech , said people sometimes ask : why not wait until children are older to start teaching them how to program ? `` Anything over the age of 7 is capable , they are capable of learning reasoning , '' she said . During a presentation earlier this month at a technology conference in Washington , D.C. , Code.org founder Hadi Partovi said less than 5 percent of U.S. high school students spend class time learning computer science while it 's a graduation requirement in China . He noted that many `` software '' jobs are outside the tech industry such as banking , retail , government and entertainment , which makes programming skills particularly versatile . `` It could mean starting your own company , '' he said . `` But it could mean you 're a doctor and you 're tired of entering the same data into a chart using paper and you want to write an app that does it for you .

T	Blue Jays mailbag : Is it time to trade Jose Bautista ? | Toronto Star
F	Blue Jays mailbag: Is it time to trade Jose Bautista? | Toronto Star
C	Blue Jays Blue Jays mailbag : Is it time to trade Jose Bautista ? The Jays are done this year as far as even pretending they can mount a comeback to 90 wins and be in the wild-card conversation . Management knows it . Fans know it . Players know it . But they still are obliged to finish out the schedule . At this point in time they need to set a more modest goal of reaching the .500 mark or at least threatening 81 wins . They need to find out which of the current players will be a part of next year 's contender because the fact is if they do n't plan to contend next year , then Rogers ownership would be excused if they might think of firing GM Alex Anthopoulos right now . However AA acknowledges that he made mistakes and he truly wants to win for the next three years . With that in mind , he should get one more chance to prove he can do exactly that in 2014 . On to the Mailbag . I for one am tired of hearing this nonsense already . I think John Gibbons is doing a fine job . Is he giving up five runs before the game is two innings old ? Is he leading the league in strikeouts with runners in scoring position ? Is he batting around .200 ? Plus he passes my `` Sam Mitchell '' test . I thought the former Raptor coach was an arrogant , condescending , first class you-know-what . When Gibbons is interviewed by the media , he is always gracious , honest and truthful . He is doing the best he can with the load he has been given . If change needs to be made I , for one , say Jose Bautista , goodbye and good riddance . A true team player/leader plays for the name on the front of the jersey not back . Jose is all about Jose , his constant battles with the umps , his exclusion from the home run derby , his place in the lineup and I could go on . This team currently `` belongs '' to Edwin Encarnacion and if he can ever get his head screwed on right it will be Brett Lawrie 's team . He is the logical choice and Canadians are just dying for him to be the star . Unfortunately he is frustratingly screwed up right now . A. A few things in response . For one , I covered a few basketball games each winter that Sam Mitchell was the Raptors coach and , despite his cantankerous nature , I loved the guy . Gibbons is also a good guy , yes , but I just think that his managing style is too day-to-day , too laissez-what and that he does n't own enough information about his current players , about their backgrounds and personalities , about the depth of the organization , about who 's got next , about what is possible from within the system that he could even possibly suggest to the general manager . The GM is not the Dalai Lama . He is finding out that he is not as smart as he thought he was . He has not been able to re-invent the role and he could use some input from his manager , but his manager remains deferential because he owes his job to the kid . As far as your observations on Bautista and Lawrie , I disagree on both . Whenever there is a late comeback for the Jays , Bautista is usually a big part of it . The other day in Oakland when he doubled down the first-base line in the 10th inning , he had a chance to be thrown out of the game earlier but held his tongue . OK , that is not exactly a great moment in sports , but it showed me that he undertands he has to be better than he has been in the first 100 games . It 's tough to be perceived as a good team leader on a team that has underachieved as much as the '13 Jays . Lawrie will never be a leader much as Jeff Kent , even though he is a borderline Hall of Famer , was never a leader . Just let Brett be a contributing follower . And the current team does not belong to Edwin . He is another talented follower . had a horrible outing , giving up four runs in the first inning and putting the Jays behind the 8-ball yet again . With only one win so far this year , I find it hard to believe John Gibbons ' recent comment that they plan to keep running Johnson out every five days until the end of the season . I also find it unbelievable that the team is talking about making a qualifying offer of $ 13 million so that they would get an extra pick in next year 's draft ... with Johnson 's record and struggles it would be highly unlikely that any team would make a higher offer , with the likely result that the Jays would be stuck with Johnson for another year and have to overpay him based on his performance this year . What do you think ? A. First of all , the Jays are not the ones to suggest that they would want to make a qualifying offer to Johnson . They are very close-mouthed with regard to their intentions in most areas . That qualifying idea has been a suggestion that I have led the way on and has always been if and only if Johnson shows that in the final two months he can pitch like a 2-3 starter . So far he has not showed that he can pitch like a 2-3 starter and that is leading to a re-visit to that opinion . If he continues to pitch like Josh Towers , then pay him like Josh Towers . A qualifying offer of $ 13 million at that point would make no sense . You are right in that if his 1-8 record is extended through the end of the season , no one would make him a matching offer and you would end up with him on a bad contract . As far as Gibbons running him out there every five days , what choice does he have ? He still has Todd Redmond starting every five days and truth be told , he 's not a true major-league starter . So where does Gibbons go with Johnson ? The Jays understand , internally , that they are not going to the post-season this year so they can afford to watch Johnson over his last 10 starts if they so desire to see if they want to qualify him or if they want to suck it up and admit a huge mistake and just let him go as a free agent . Love the mailbag !! Your thoughts on catching . If the Jays are unable to upgrade at catcher over the winter , do you think they will ever get tough with J.P. Arencibia and insist he adopt a reasonable two-strike approach and improve defensively OR get sent back to AAA to work things out . I mean , Ricky Romero , Adam Lind and Brett Cecil all got sent back to AAA when they struggled . Why not Arencibia ( or Brett Lawrie for that matter ) ? J.P. is clearly struggling at the major league level offensively and defensively . Would love to know your thoughts on this . I do believe Arencibia can get much better if he puts his mind to it . Some tough love may be warranted . Thanks Richard . A. Catching is the toughest and most important position on the field . I honestly believe that the Jays rotation has underachieved in part because of J.P. Arencibia . Throwing out base runners is important . Arencibia is not good at that . Framing pitches is important . Statistically Arencibia is acceptable at that but watching him in person , he does not seem as good as those numbers suggest . Blocking balls in the dirt , Arencibia is not good at that . Leading pitchers through the minefield of a major-league game ? Is he good at that ? Pitchers will never throw their teammate under a bus . Look at the veterans on the Jays that have underachieved . Any pitcher with Pat Borders back there would throw a pitch in the dirt with two strikes with no hesitation . I honestly believe that AAA for Arencibia is not the answer . I honestly believe at that age you do n't just get it in the minors and become another Johnny Bench . The Jays need to find a catcher that can do all those things right now . I like J.P. Arencibia as a person but instead of It 's become increasingly clear that JPA 's poor defence combined with little or no offence other than the long ball is really hurting the Blue Jays . That and his moronic and childish tirades against ( Gregg Zaun ) and Dirk Hayhurst for speaking the truth would suggest to me that its time he was sent packing . Brian McCann is a free agent this year I believe and he would look fabulous in a Jays uniform and bring great leadership behind the plate as well . What kind of numbers do you think it would take to sign him and what odds would you give that the Jays go after him ? A. Brian McCann played 120 games or more for seven straight seasons from 2006-12 , but will be fortunate in 2013 to reach 100 games due to earlier injury . That being said , at age 29 , he has a chance as a free agent in 2014 to hit the jackpot . The Jays would be well-served to target McCann and make him a solid offer and to compete hard for his services . The Jays ' top catcher in the system is A.J. Jimenez who is not ready to take on the load of being a No. 1 receiver and therefore if the Jays want to compete in 2014 they need to go outside the organization for a starting catcher . Home runs and RBIs that Arencibia has posted among the top numbers in baseball do not an elite catcher make . Q. Does n't this game ( in Oakland ) show a fatal flaw in the management `` theory '' of Gibbons ? Esmil Rogers got hit hard and threw a lot of pitches early . Bringing him back out for the fifth inning was the big mistake . At best , he would have had only one inning left in him , at worst , we saw what happened . It 's a great idea to try and save the bullpen another inning 's work , but when the bullpen is the strongest part of the staff , they need to be used . Too many times , too many games , Gibbons tries to stretch a starter and it leads to these kinds of situations . Just so tired of this mess of a team . A. That view of going one inning too far is often hindsight and , personally , unless I thought such a thing before that failed decision , unless I thought in advance that a pitcher should not have been sent back out for one more , even if a guy that has been struggling gives up a six-spot I am reluctant to criticize ... and I did n't feel that way about Rogers on this occasion . To criticize Gibbons for not using his bullpen enough is silly . There is not a team in baseball that makes as much and as judicious use of its relievers as the Jays . The bullpen is the strongest part of this staff , but if they are used any more than they have been we might as well call them `` starters . '' Given that the Jays are now out of the race this old Blue Jay fan has once again started reminiscing about baseball glory past . This brought me back to a May ( ? ) night in the Seattle Kingdome during the 1992 season . Details are sketchy but the Jays were down by a LOT then a late comeback starts . Finally in the ninth inning Winfield hits a grand slam to put the Jays ahead by one and they hold on to win the game . This to me is the home run that turned the franchise into World Champions . Sure Alomar 's home run off Eckersley was huge , as was Carter 's off Williams ( understatements I know ) . However , I believe that neither of those hits would have had the opportunity to happen had the Winfield HR not proven that this TEAM could come back from any deficit , at any time . That home run , in my opinion , changed the team from ` talented ' to ` winners . ' I know you did not work in Toronto at the time , but I would appreciate your comments and opinion . A. The game to which you refer was played on May 7 , 1992 at the Kingdome , an 8-7 win for the Jays scoring five runs in the ninth with Tom Henke picking up the save . The starter that gave up seven runs in 4.1 innings was Jack Morris . The winner with 3.1 innings of shutout relief was Pat Hentgen . In the ninth , Manny Lee singled home a run and then Winfield connected for a slam against Mike Schooler . It was a huge win for the Jays and a big moment for Winfield , but it made the Jays 21-9 and they were already showing the ability to be a dominant team . It was not a turnaround moment because these guys , under Cito , knew they were good and likely would have kept winning even without that comeback . But a solid memory from a good fan . Beeston still points to Alomar 's homer off Eckersley as the moment . Blue Jays mailbag from July 26th and it seems like the majority of your readers are n't willing to place any blame for this season on AA . He took the risk and made two big deals that gutted the prospect depth and he assembled the rest of this team . He 's like the Teflon GM - nothing bad sticks to him . In your opinion should n't AA be held accountable if this team continues to struggle this year ? I 'm not saying he should be fired but his seat should start heating up . A. The readers to which you refer are my regular readers - smart , savvy , dedicated , like everyone else that understands the game , keen observers of baseball that are reluctant to pile onto failed moves in hindsight . Anyone can do that . It 's easy to place blame on AA now , as the team flounders at 6-10 games under .500 , but I vividly recall the fan euphoria of Nov. / Dec. '12 and I have marvelled at the number of 30,000-plus gates through the first two-thirds of the 2013 season . So have the bean counters at Rogers . AA has been stunned by the many failures of this current roster , no doubt . Hopefully he has learned things about the job and about himself . It 's not a position you can re-invent or be dismissive about with regard to the GMs that have been around for a long time . They do know something about the game . Anthopoulos said he had some solid trade deadline discussions that , he indicated to us in Oakland , will lead to moves in the off-season to make this team , with some tweaking , what he thought he had . My read on the Anthopoulos situation is that if he adds in the off-season at second base , starting pitcher or catcher then he understands and wants to win . If he trades off parts that he acquired last winter , then his seat immediately heats up , not with fans but with the bosses who expected the Jays to be contenders as promised by AA for the next three years . Those are the people he needs to satisfy , not fans . What 's with the Blue Jays ability to break starting pitchers ? Not only have they been sending them to the DL at an alarming rate over the past few years , even when healthy they ca n't pitch ( Ricky Romero , R.A. Dickey , Josh Johnson ) . I do n't buy ` the injuries will happen and we are just unlucky ' excuse . That can only apply to J.A. Happ . In my mind it 's poor mechanics , poor strength and conditioning and poor preparation that send so many pitchers under the knife or to the DL . If that 's the case , are we likely to see sweeping changes to the backroom staff in the offseason ? The rotation clearly was n't ready to go physically when the season started . *NL* It 's taken 100 + games for the team to accept Johnson 's mechanics are a mess . Surely the pitching coach needs to take some blame for all this . I ca n't believe it 's coincidence that so many good pitchers ( Dickey , Johnson , Romero ) regress so remarkably . The bullpen has been great , are we likely to see Pete Walker replaced by Pat Hentgen ? Who would you bring in if you were GM ? *NL* *NL* Keep up the great mailbag - it 's always interesting to read your opinion on things . *NL* *NL* A. You ca n't count Kyle Drabek , Drew Hutchison and Luis Perez as injuries this year since they were all 2012 Tommy Johns . By the way , one of the best trivia questions I know is `` Who in the history of major-league baseball has recorded the most pitching wins post-Tommy John surgery ? '' The answer is Tommy John . As for this Jays organization being any worse than other organizations , just check out the Red Sox injury report for the last two seasons . They have been equally devastated but you do n't hear the same whining from fans . I find it hard to believe that from your seat at home you can ascertain that it 's `` poor mechanics , poor strength and conditioning and poor preparation . '' That is an insult to me and other media members who are in the clubhouse and around the players every day and have not come to that same conclusion . How can you determine that from where you are ? The one thing I agree with you about is that this team was not ready for the season to start on April 1 . Bad spring . As for Pat Hentgen , if he is willing to give up the time , he can be a great MLB pitching coach . Q. We in Vancouver are very fortunate that the Canadians , Northwest League affiliate of the Blue Jays , have a very committed local ownership group that continues to incrementally improve the fan experience at Nat Bailey stadium ; resulting in frequent sellouts . Recently our community paper , Vancouver Courier , ran a comprehensive article on the Canadians in which the Blue Jays assistant general manager Tony LaCava was quoted as saying `` the lifeblood of any major league team is the players that are signed and developed internally . '' My personal experience of 40 years in management and company ownership is that more often than not when a company hires a star , the star 's performance plunges and correspondingly there is a sharp decline in the functioning of the team . Respected research supports this theory , suggesting that you are better off growing stars than buying them . The foregoing is based on the premise that the broad principles of effective team building are universal whether for a construction site , hospital operating room or baseball arena . Can you foresee a future in which the Blue Jays ownership has the fortitude to support Mr. LaCava 's solid strategy to build a sustainable winning team ? A. First of all , in speaking to Alex Anthopoulos back when he was an assistant GM to J.P. Ricciardi , he suggested that if he was a GM he would want Canadian affiliates for a Canadian Blue Jays team . When he took over he quickly added the Vancouver Canadians and suggested behind the scenes that he wanted the top prospects in the organization to experience playing in Canada to get the feel of loonies and toonies in their pocket and to give the Vancouver team a winner each and every year . So it 's not all about the team 's ownership on scene for the success that Vancouver has enjoyed . The Blue Jays have operated under AA 's leadership with that LaCava philosophy . They have wanted to build the nucleus from within , using homegrown stars and then use other inventory to make key trades to build a championship roster . However AA and his management team may have overestimated the base of talent that they had as they reached out to the Marlins and Mets . They may have overestimated the readiness of Ricky Romero , Brandon Morrow , J.P. Arencibia and Colby Rasmus . But the fact is they still believe in that philosophy , but may have been a little kneejerk in accelerating the process because of the defection of manager John Farrell and the seeming vulnerability of the AL East . I really enjoy your responses on here . *NL* My questions : Josh Johnson is obviously struggling . Watching it on TV , it looks like the ball is coming in right down the middle with no movement and hitters are picking up on that . So , why do they keep putting him in ? Is there no one else in the bullpen who is itching to be a starter ? It 's frustrating for fans and probably for the team and Johnson . He needs to take a step back and figure out what 's gone wrong . In other sports he would be given a couple of chances to play better and then he 'd be benched . Why not in baseball ? *NL* Since when does Adam Lind chase the breaking ball low and outside ? He looks like Vernon Wells from a few years ago . *NL* Finally , with more and more use of pitchtrax , you can see that a lot of pitches that are out of the strike zone are called as strikes . I can see high/low being a judgment call based on the batter 's height and stance . But some of this stuff looks like it 's six inches outside . ( And the farther the Jays fall in the standings the less often they seem to get the call . ) My question is , do you think the umpiring crews or supervisors follow up on this stuff and show the guy behind the plate how off his calls were ? Or does the umping fraternity just discount pitchtrax as hocus pocus . Hitters seem to be shaking their heads about the calls but 9 times out of 10 it looks like they are right and the ump is not . *NL* A. Josh Johnson is struggling , but he also is making $ 13.75 million and can not be sent down without permission . If you are in hockey or basketball you can either not be in uniform for a game or be at the end of the bench , but in baseball if you 're on the roster you have to pitch . Adam Lind had a great start to the season that earned him an everyday role even against left-handers , however lately he has struggled more against southpaws , especially against those sweeping breaking balls that end up low and away outside of his strike zone . Lind is somewhere in-between . As for the pitch-tracking graphic , I wish they would just scrap it and let us enjoy the game and have our own opinions on balls and strikes . It 's a no-win for hitters and umpires and there are balls seemingly in the dirt that the tracker has touching the bottom of the strike box . Even if they do , in real life when an umpire sees a catcher turn his glove over to catch a pitch that is usually a ball no matter what the TV screen says . Many times , the balls and strikes if missed are not the umpire 's fault but the catcher 's . Why not have a `` three-seconds-in-the-paint '' clock on screen for every NBA trip down the court ? That would embarrass the refs and the league , but what else would it accomplish . Your mailbag is like `` manna in the desert . '' Keep 'em comin ' !! Just thought I 'd throw a silver lining into the dark cloud that is the Jays starting rotation . I think next year 's starting rotation is going to be lights out - from an AAA perspective that is . Looks like the Bisons starting rotation in 2014 will be : Romero/Nolin/Stroman / Drabek/Huchison . Pretty good I think . Two questions . Firstly , which of these five guys do you think is most likely to help the Jays starting rotation in 2014 and secondly , is Coca-Cola field a nice place to watch a ball game ? I 'm thinking of taking a trip next year to see one of these guys ( not Romero though ) . Oh , and my prediction for the Jays starting rotation on opening day next year is : Dickey/Morrow / Buehrle/Happ/McGowan . I 'd prefer they overpay Buehrle and at least get a decent performance than overpay Johnson and be disappointed yet again ( no way Johnson turns down the qualifying offer and $ 14M is too much to risk just to protect a draft pick whose last name is n't Strasburg or Harper ) . A. Couple of comments . Romero will not be in Buffalo on Opening Day 2014 . He will either be with the Jays or more likely in another organization . Marcus Stroman may be in the Jays rotation or else a key reliever by mid May , 2014 . One of Drabek or Hutchison will be in the Jays rotation . Nolin will be a Bison . Buffalo 's ballpark is worth the Friday/Saturday with an overnight stay downtown . But you better hurry because the season ends at the end of this month . But you 're planning on doing it next year so you 're OK . As for Johnson , if he does n't show any better by the end of the season , they will not make the qualifying offer . That is the most perplexing loss of ability I have seen in a while . I 'm pretty sure that this email will get lost in the shuffle of emails you get but I thought I 'd offer a small one for Tom Cheek . I 'm deaf and I was a student of Pineland Public School in Burlington , Ont . Since I 'm deaf , I was excused from two classes - French and Music so during those periods , I would go to my study hall which was overseen by George Fox . George would work with me on various subjects and helped me stay up with the class . It was a tough environment for me to be in - a deaf kid in a hearing school but I thrived . One day , Mr. Fox had a guest with him and he introduced him as Tom Cheek . I shook his hand and I said it was very nice to meet you . I did n't understand the importance of having Mr. Cheek in the classroom with Mr. Fox . So Mr. Fox explained that Mr. Cheek worked as a radio broadcaster for the Toronto Blue Jays . The concept of radio broadcasting was alien to a deaf kid like me back then but nonetheless , Mr. Cheek had a big smile on his face . He sat down with me and worked over some of my math problems with me . He was warm and friendly but I did not grasp the importance of his visit with me or the importance of his voice across Canada . The phrase `` touch them all Joe '' did not really resonate with me until much later . After he passed away , the accolades and tributes poured in for Tom Cheek . It was n't until I saw his picture that this was the same man I met at Pineland Public school when I was 14 years old . I was in shock . Tom Cheek helped me with my homework ?! Today I live in Anthem , AZ . i have two cochlear implants and my hearing has been surgically restored . I can pick up a few things on the radio . Once I was able to follow a McDonald 's jingle all the way through that lasted 30 seconds . I did n't realize fully that radios do have commercials . And when I think about what I hear on the radio , I always look back to that quiet , shy , but friendly man Tom Cheek who helped me with my homework . A. What a great way to end a Mailbag .

H	Blue Jays  \n<div class="article-headline">\n<h1>Blue Jays mailbag: Is it time to trade Jose Bautista?</h1>\n</div>\n<a href="http://www.thestar.com/sports/bluejays.html">The Jays</a> are done this year as far\nas even pretending they can mount a comeback to 90 wins and be in the wild-card conversation.\nManagement knows it. Fans know it. Players know it. But they still are obliged to finish out\nthe schedule. At this point in time they need to set a more modest goal of reaching the .500\nmark or at least threatening 81 wins. They need to find out which of the current players will\nbe a part of next year's contender because the fact is if they don't plan to contend next\nyear, then Rogers ownership would be excused if they might think of firing GM Alex Anthopoulos\nright now. However AA acknowledges that he made mistakes and he truly wants to win for the\nnext three years. With that in mind, he should get one more chance to prove he can do exactly\nthat in 2014. On to the Mailbag.\n<b>I for one am tired of hearing this nonsense already. I think John Gibbons is doing a fine\njob. Is he giving up five runs before the game is two innings old? Is he leading the league in\nstrikeouts with runners in scoring position? Is he batting around .200? Plus he passes my "Sam\nMitchell" test. I thought the former Raptor coach was an arrogant, condescending, first class\nyou-know-what. When Gibbons is interviewed by the media, he is always gracious, honest and\ntruthful. He is doing the best he can with the load he has been given.</b>\n<b>If change needs to be made I, for one, say Jose Bautista, goodbye and good riddance. A true\nteam player/leader plays for the name on the front of the jersey not back. Jose is all about\nJose, his constant battles with the umps, his exclusion from the home run derby, his place in\nthe lineup and I could go on. This team currently "belongs" to Edwin Encarnacion and if he can\never get his head screwed on right it will be Brett Lawrie's team. He is the logical choice\nand Canadians are just dying for him to be the star. Unfortunately he is frustratingly screwed\nup right now.</b>\n<p>A. A few things in response. For one, I covered a few basketball games each winter that Sam\nMitchell was</p>\n<a href="http://www.thestar.com/sports/raptors.html">the Raptors</a> coach and, despite his\ncantankerous nature, I loved the guy. Gibbons is also a good guy, yes, but I just think that\nhis managing style is too day-to-day, too laissez-what and that he doesn't own enough\ninformation about his current players, about their backgrounds and personalities, about the\ndepth of the organization, about who's got next, about what is possible from within the system\nthat he could even possibly suggest to the general manager. The GM is not the Dalai Lama. He\nis finding out that he is not as smart as he thought he was. He has not been able to re-invent\nthe role and he could use some input from his manager, but his manager remains deferential\nbecause he owes his job to the kid.\n<div class="text combinedtext parbase section">\n<p>As far as your observations on Bautista and Lawrie, I disagree on both. Whenever there is a\nlate comeback for the Jays, Bautista is usually a big part of it. The other day in Oakland\nwhen he doubled down the first-base line in the 10th inning, he had a chance to be thrown out\nof the game earlier but held his tongue. OK, that is not exactly a great moment in sports, but\nit showed me that he undertands he has to be better than he has been in the first 100 games.\nIt's tough to be perceived as a good team leader on a team that has underachieved as much as\nthe '13 Jays. Lawrie will never be a leader much as Jeff Kent, even though he is a borderline\nHall of Famer, was never a leader. Just let Brett be a contributing follower. And the current\nteam does not belong to Edwin. He is another talented follower.</p>\n</div>\nhad a horrible outing<b>, giving up four runs in the first inning and putting the Jays behind\nthe 8-ball yet again.

This to me is the home run that turned the\nfranchise into World Champions.</b>\n<b>Sure Alomar's home run off Eckersley was huge, as was Carter's off Williams\n(understatements I know). However, I believe that neither of those hits would have had the\nopportunity to happen had the Winfield HR not proven that this TEAM could come back from any\ndeficit, at any time. That home run, in my opinion, changed the team from 'talented' to\n'winners.' I know you did not work in Toronto at the time, but I would appreciate your\ncomments and opinion.</b>\n<p>A. The game to which you refer was played on May 7, 1992 at the Kingdome, an 8-7 win for\nthe Jays scoring five runs in the ninth with Tom Henke picking up the save. The starter that\ngave up seven runs in 4.1 innings was Jack Morris. The winner with 3.1 innings of shutout\nrelief was Pat Hentgen. In the ninth, Manny Lee singled home a run and then Winfield connected\nfor a slam against Mike Schooler. It was a huge win for the Jays and a big moment for\nWinfield, but it made the Jays 21-9 and they were already showing the ability to be a dominant\nteam. It was not a turnaround moment because these guys, under Cito, knew they were good and\nlikely would have kept winning even without that comeback. But a solid memory from a good fan.\nBeeston still points to Alomar's homer off Eckersley as the moment.</p>\nBlue Jays mailbag from July 26th<b> and it seems like the majority of your readers aren't\nwilling to place any blame for this season on AA. He took the risk and made two big deals that\ngutted the prospect depth and he assembled the rest of this team. He's like the Teflon GM -\nnothing bad sticks to him. In your opinion shouldn't AA be held accountable if this team\ncontinues to struggle this year? I'm not saying he should be fired but his seat should start\nheating up.</b>\n<p>A. The readers to which you refer are my regular readers - smart, savvy, dedicated, like\neveryone else that understands the game, keen observers of baseball that are reluctant to pile\nonto failed moves in hindsight. Anyone can do that. It's easy to place blame on AA now, as the\nteam flounders at 6-10 games under .500, but I vividly recall the fan euphoria of Nov./Dec.\n'12 and I have marvelled at the number of 30,000-plus gates through the first two-thirds of\nthe 2013 season. So have the bean counters at Rogers.</p>\n<div class="text combinedtext parbase section">\n<p>AA has been stunned by the many failures of this current roster, no doubt. Hopefully he has\nlearned things about the job and about himself. It's not a position you can re-invent or be\ndismissive about with regard to the GMs that have been around for a long time. They do know\nsomething about the game. Anthopoulos said he had some solid trade deadline discussions that,\nhe indicated to us in Oakland, will lead to moves in the off-season to make this team, with\nsome tweaking, what he thought he had.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="text combinedtext parbase section">\n<p>My read on the Anthopoulos situation is that if he adds in the off-season at second base,\nstarting pitcher or catcher then he understands and wants to win. If he trades off parts that\nhe acquired last winter, then his seat immediately heats up, not with fans but with the bosses\nwho expected the Jays to be contenders as promised by AA for the next three years. Those are\nthe people he needs to satisfy, not fans.</p>\n</div>\n<p><b>What's with the Blue Jays ability to break starting pitchers? Not only have they been\nsending them to the DL at an alarming rate over the past few years, even when healthy they\ncan't pitch (Ricky Romero, R.A. Dickey, Josh Johnson). I don't buy 'the injuries will happen\nand we are just unlucky' excuse. That can only apply to J.A. Happ. In my mind it's poor\nmechanics, poor strength and conditioning and poor preparation that send so many pitchers\nunder the knife or to the DL.</b></p>\n<b>If that's the case, are we likely to see sweeping changes to the backroom staff in the\noffseason? The rotation clearly wasn't ready to go physically when the season started.?It's\ntaken 100+ games for the team to accept Johnson's mechanics are a mess. Surely the pitching\ncoach needs to take some blame for all this. I can't believe it's coincidence that so many\ngood pitchers (Dickey, Johnson, Romero) regress so remarkably. The bullpen has been great, are\nwe likely to see Pete Walker replaced by Pat Hentgen? Who would you bring in if you were\nGM???</b>\n<b>Keep up the great mailbag - it's always interesting to read your opinion on things.??</b>\n<p>A. You can't count Kyle Drabek, Drew Hutchison and Luis Perez as injuries this year since\nthey were all 2012 Tommy Johns. By the way, one of the best trivia questions I know is "Who in\nthe history of major-league baseball has recorded the most pitching wins post-Tommy John\nsurgery?" The answer is Tommy John. As for this Jays organization being any worse than other\norganizations, just check out the Red Sox injury report for the last two seasons. They have\nbeen equally devastated but you don't hear the same whining from fans. I find it hard to\nbelieve that from your seat at home you can ascertain that it's "poor mechanics, poor strength\nand conditioning and poor preparation." That is an insult to me and other media members who\nare in the clubhouse and around the players every day and have not come to that same\nconclusion. How can you determine that from where you are? The one thing I agree with you\nabout is that this team was not ready for the season to start on April 1. Bad spring. As for\nPat Hentgen, if he is willing to give up the time, he can be a great MLB pitching coach.</p>\n<div class="text combinedtext parbase section">\n<p><b>Q. We in Vancouver are very fortunate that the Canadians, Northwest League affiliate of\nthe Blue Jays, have a very committed local ownership group that continues to incrementally\nimprove the fan experience at Nat Bailey stadium; resulting in frequent sellouts.</b></p>\n</div>\n<b>Recently our community paper, Vancouver Courier, ran a comprehensive article on the\nCanadians in which the Blue Jays assistant general manager Tony LaCava was quoted as saying\n"the lifeblood of any major league team is the players that are signed and developed\ninternally."</b>\n<b>My personal experience of 40 years in management and company ownership is that more often\nthan not when a company hires a star, the star's performance plunges and correspondingly there\nis a sharp decline in the functioning of the team. Respected research supports this theory,\nsuggesting that you are better off growing stars than buying them. The foregoing is based on\nthe premise that the broad principles of effective team building are universal whether for a\nconstruction site, hospital operating room or baseball arena.</b>\n<b>Can you foresee a future in which the Blue Jays ownership has the fortitude to support Mr.\nLaCava's solid strategy to build a sustainable winning team?</b>\n<p>A. First of all, in speaking to Alex Anthopoulos back when he was an assistant GM to J.P.\nRicciardi, he suggested that if he was a GM he would want Canadian affiliates for a Canadian\nBlue Jays team. When he took over he quickly added the Vancouver Canadians and suggested\nbehind the scenes that he wanted the top prospects in the organization to experience playing\nin Canada to get the feel of loonies and toonies in their pocket and to give the Vancouver\nteam a winner each and every year. So it's not all about the team's ownership on scene for the\nsuccess that Vancouver has enjoyed.</p>\n<div class="text combinedtext parbase section">\n<p>The Blue Jays have operated under AA's leadership with that LaCava philosophy. They have\nwanted to build the nucleus from within, using homegrown stars and then use other inventory to\nmake key trades to build a championship roster. However AA and his management team may have\noverestimated the base of talent that they had as they reached out to the Marlins and Mets.\nThey may have overestimated the readiness of Ricky Romero, Brandon Morrow, J.P. Arencibia and\nColby Rasmus. But the fact is they still believe in that philosophy, but may have been a\nlittle kneejerk in accelerating the process because of the defection of manager John Farrell\nand the seeming vulnerability of the AL East.</p>\n</div>\n<b>I really enjoy your responses on here.?My questions: Josh Johnson is obviously struggling.\nWatching it on TV, it looks like the ball is coming in right down the middle with no movement\nand hitters are picking up on that. So, why do they keep putting him in? Is there no one else\nin the bullpen who is itching to be a starter? It's frustrating for fans and probably for the\nteam and Johnson. He needs to take a step back and figure out what's gone wrong. In other\nsports he would be given a couple of chances to play better and then he'd be benched. Why not\nin baseball??</b>\n<b>Since when does Adam Lind chase the breaking ball low and outside? He looks like Vernon\nWells from a few years ago.?Finally, with more and more use of pitchtrax, you can see that a\nlot of pitches that are out of the strike zone are called as strikes. I can see high/low being\na judgment call based on the batter's height and stance. But some of this stuff looks like\nit's six inches outside. (And the farther the Jays fall in the standings the less often they\nseem to get the call.) My question is, do you think the umpiring crews or supervisors follow\nup on this stuff and show the guy behind the plate how off his calls were? Or does the umping\nfraternity just discount pitchtrax as hocus pocus. Hitters seem to be shaking their heads\nabout the calls but 9 times out of 10 it looks like they are right and the ump is not.?</b>\n<p>A. Josh Johnson is struggling, but he also is making $13.75 million and cannot be sent down\nwithout permission. If you are in hockey or basketball you can either not be in uniform for a\ngame or be at the end of the bench, but in baseball if you're on the roster you have to\npitch.</p>\n<div class="text combinedtext parbase section">\n<p>Adam Lind had a great start to the season that earned him an everyday role even against\nleft-handers, however lately he has struggled more against southpaws, especially against those\nsweeping breaking balls that end up low and away outside of his strike zone. Lind is somewhere\nin-between. As for the pitch-tracking graphic, I wish they would just scrap it and let us\nenjoy the game and have our own opinions on balls and strikes. It's a no-win for hitters and\numpires and there are balls seemingly in the dirt that the tracker has touching the bottom of\nthe strike box. Even if they do, in real life when an umpire sees a catcher turn his glove\nover to catch a pitch that is usually a ball no matter what the TV screen says. Many times,\nthe balls and strikes if missed are not the umpire's fault but the catcher's. Why not have a\n"three-seconds-in-the-paint" clock on screen for every NBA trip down the court? That would\nembarrass the refs and the league, but what else would it accomplish.</p>\n</div>\n<b>Your mailbag is like "manna in the desert." Keep 'em comin'!! Just thought I'd throw a\nsilver lining into the dark cloud that is the Jays starting rotation. I think next year's\nstarting rotation is going to be lights out - from an AAA perspective that is.</b>\n<b>Looks like the Bisons starting rotation in 2014 will be:\nRomero/Nolin/Stroman/Drabek/Huchison. Pretty good I think. Two questions. Firstly, which of\nthese five guys do you think is most likely to help the Jays starting rotation in 2014 and\nsecondly, is Coca-Cola field a nice place to watch a ball game? I'm thinking of taking a trip\nnext year to see one of these guys (not Romero though).</b>\n<b>Oh, and my prediction for the Jays starting rotation on opening day next year is:\nDickey/Morrow/ Buehrle/Happ/McGowan. I'd prefer they overpay Buehrle and at least get a decent\nperformance than overpay Johnson and be disappointed yet again (no way Johnson turns down the\nqualifying offer and $14M is too much to risk just to protect a draft pick whose last name\nisn't Strasburg or Harper).</b>\n<p>A. Couple of comments. Romero will not be in Buffalo on Opening Day 2014. He will either be\nwith the Jays or more likely in another organization. Marcus Stroman may be in the Jays\nrotation or else a key reliever by mid May, 2014. One of Drabek or Hutchison will be in the\nJays rotation. Nolin will be a Bison. Buffalo's ballpark is worth the Friday/Saturday with an\novernight stay downtown. But you better hurry because the season ends at the end of this\nmonth. But you're planning on doing it next year so you're OK. As for Johnson, if he doesn't\nshow any better by the end of the season, they will not make the qualifying offer. That is the\nmost perplexing loss of ability I have seen in a while.</p>\n<b>I'm pretty sure that this email will get lost in the shuffle of emails you get but I\nthought I'd offer a</b>\nsmall one for Tom Cheek<b>. I'm deaf and I was a student of Pineland Public School in\nBurlington, Ont. Since I'm deaf, I was excused from two classes - French and Music so during\nthose periods, I would go to my study hall which was overseen by George Fox. George would work\nwith me on various subjects and helped me stay up with the class.</b>\n<b>It was a tough environment for me to be in - a deaf kid in a hearing school but I thrived.\nOne day, Mr. Fox had a guest with him and he introduced him as Tom Cheek. I shook his hand and\nI said it was very nice to meet you. I didn't understand the importance of having Mr. Cheek in\nthe classroom with Mr. Fox. So Mr. Fox explained that Mr. Cheek worked as a radio broadcaster\nfor the Toronto Blue Jays. The concept of radio broadcasting was alien to a deaf kid like me\nback then but nonetheless, Mr. Cheek had a big smile on his face. He sat down with me and\nworked over some of my math problems with me. He was warm and friendly but I did not grasp the\nimportance of his visit with me or the importance of his voice across Canada.</b>\n<b>The phrase "touch them all Joe" did not really resonate with me until much later. After he\npassed away, the accolades and tributes poured in for Tom Cheek. It wasn't until I saw his\npicture that this was the same man I met at Pineland Public school when I was 14 years old. I\nwas in shock. Tom Cheek helped me with my homework?!</b>\n<b>Today I live in Anthem, AZ. i have two cochlear implants and my hearing has been surgically\nrestored. I can pick up a few things on the radio. Once I was able to follow a McDonald's\njingle all the way through that lasted 30 seconds. I didn't realize fully that radios do have\ncommercials. And when I think about what I hear on the radio, I always look back to that\nquiet, shy, but friendly man Tom Cheek who helped me with my homework.</b>\n<p>A. What a great way to end a Mailbag.

Atlanta police spokesman John Chafee confirmed the death of the man , whose name has not been released . The man fell during Monday night 's game between the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies . ( AP Photo/Atlanta Journal Constitution , Curtis Compton ) MARIETTA DAILY OUT , GWINNETT DAILY POST OUT ) LOCAL TV OUT ( WXIA , WGCL , FOX 5 ) . ( Curtis Compton ) ATLANTA - A man who fell more than 60 feet from an upper-level platform at Atlanta 's Turner Field onto a parking lot during a baseball game died Monday night , police said . Atlanta police spokesman John Chafee confirmed the death of the man , whose name has not been released . The man fell during Monday night 's game between the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies . `` At this time there 's no indication of foul play and the fall appears accidental , '' Chafee said late Monday . `` It appears he fell from an upper-level platform to a secured lot below . '' Chafee said police received the report of the fall just before 9 p.m. Monday . When officers arrived , they located a man who appeared to have fallen 65 feet , or about six stories .

F	Digi-Key y Digilent Inc. firman un acuerdo de distribuci?n a nivel mundial | SYS-CON MEDIA
C	distribuidor de componentes electr?nicos a nivel mundial Digi-Key Corporation , l?der industrial en selecci?n , disponibilidad y entrega de componentes electr?nicos , anunci? hoy la firma de un acuerdo de distribuci?n a nivel mundial con Digilent Inc. Esta empresa se especializa en placas y productos de ingenier?a utilizados para herramientas de dise?o educacional basados en la tecnolog?a que utilizan muchos estudiantes y universidades del mundo . Los kits de educaci?n y desarrollo de Digilent sirven de herramientas `` h?galo usted mismo '' para estudiantes que utilizan computadoras con placa ?nica en educaci?n superior . Los estudiantes pueden solicitar f?cilmente los kits rentables directamente en digikey.com . Clint Cole y Gene Apperson , dos profesores de ingenier?a el?ctrica de la universidad Washington State University , fundaron Digilent en el a?o 2000 . Al ense?ar , estos profesores vieron la necesidad de una placa de programaci?n b?sica para ayudar al aprendizaje pr?ctico de sus estudiantes . Cuando vieron que las placas tuvieron un gran impacto , se han esforzado para que la ?ltima tecnolog?a digital sea comprensible , asequible y de f?cil acceso para todos . Digi-Key y Digilent se dieron cuenta del beneficio de trabajar juntos , ya que ambos vend?an productos sinerg?ticos a los ingenieros de desarrollo en universidades y facultades del mundo . `` Digi-Key se complace en estar alineado con Digilent y comparte el objetivo de que los estudiantes y desarrolladores del mundo puedan acceder a la ingenier?a el?ctrica y al dise?o '' , dijo Mark Zack , vicepresidente de productos de semiconductores de nivel mundial de Digi-Key . `` Los objetivos del programa acad?mico de Digi-Key de colocar la informaci?n y las tecnolog?as en la primera fila de la comunidad acad?mica se lograr? mejor a trav?s de esta relaci?n estrat?gica con Digilent .

T	CHANCES R. ... : Mares ' Tails - Rain or No ?
F	CHANCES R.....: Mares' Tails - Rain or No?
C	Yesterday morning Bud said , `` I 'm going down to the pond and throw in a line or two . '' I told him I would take my book out on the deck and watch him from there .

The voice in my head said mares ' tails . Mares ' tails - that 's what my Mom called those high , thin clouds . Did n't they mean rain was coming ? I posted one of my cloud pictures on Facebook with the note `` I do hope these mares ' tails presage a sorely needed rain ! '' A cousin on my Mom 's side said she had `` never heard them called that before '' , while one on my Dad 's side asked `` are they a forecast for rain ? '' I can remember both my Grandmothers and my Mom having sayings relating to all kinds of weather .

There is no need to understand what the clouds or wind direction or any other weather changes may be telling us . A couple hours after I took the mares ' tail pics , the clouds had thickened and darkened . It really did look like it could rain , but did n't . Then around 4:15 this morning I was awakened by a flash of lightening followed by thunder . And , a few minutes later , RAIN ! Unfortunately the rain did n't last long enough , but any little bit helps . ( There 's an interesting page about Mares ' Tails and Mackerel Skies here . ) This is what the sky looked like off to the southwest when I went out to check the rain gauge ( middle post ) early this morning . We got 20/100ths of an inch . And while it did still look very rainy , we did n't receive any more . But hey , now that it 's rained some , maybe Mother Nature remembers how it 's done . I can still hear Grandma Bessie Lynam saying `` Red skies at night , sailors ' delight ; red skies at morning , sailors take warning '' . What about your parents and grandparents ?

T	Inside Dodger Baseball : Did Nolasco pitch his way out of an NLDS start ?
F	Inside Dodger Baseball: Did Nolasco pitch his way out of an NLDS start?
C	Ricky Nolasco took one last start in the regular season on Wednesday night in San Francisco , looking to erase some bad vibes from his previous two starts . The result ? Uh , not good . The Giants had little trouble hitting him around in a 6-4 win , as he gave up six runs on eight hits in 5?2/3 innings . The only good news was that he struck out seven and only walked one , but it hardly mattered . He 's been hit around really hard his last three trips to the mound , and now the question has to be if he 'll even get a start in October . It 's a pretty big turnaround from his first 12 starts with the Dodgers after coming over from the Marlins . In those he went 8-1 with a 1.82 ERA , and in 10 of those starts he surrendered two or less earned runs . And let me tell you , he sure looked like he was going to overtake Hyun-Jin Ryu for that Game 3 start , because his stuff looked incredible . And then came the start he made at home on Saturday , September 14 against the Giants in which he was absolutely shelled . He only lasted four outs , giving up seven runs ( five earned ) on seven hits , walking three , and recorded no strikeouts . Boy was he bad that night . The hope was that that game would be an anomaly , but thus far , it sure has n't looked like it . The Diamondbacks got to him for six runs in five innings on September 19 , and then last night 's game against the Giants . Add up those three starts , and he 's 0-2 with a 12.75 ERA . Talk about a big dropoff . So , let 's pose the question right now : Will Nolasco get a start in the NLDS ? One thing that we have to keep in mind is that the NLDS schedule plays a big factor in Don Mattingly 's decision when to use his pitchers . While the times will need to be worked out , the days the games occur has been set : October 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 , and 9 . In looking at this , Clayton Kershaw will make a Game 1 start , then go on Game 5 if necessary on five day 's rest . Zack Greinke will go in Game 2 and could also pitch in Game 5 since he 'd be on four day 's rest . But , I ca n't imagine him getting the call over Kershaw . With that in mind , it appears as if Mattingly will have to use four separate starters in the NLDS , as the schedule , barring a rainout , wo n't allow anything different . So , Nolasco looks to be in good shape to at least be a candidate for a Game 4 start . Being a candidate and actually getting the start are two different things , though . I 'm not sure anybody thought they 'd see this happen , but Volquez 's start tonight against the Giants could play a big part in who gets an NLDS start . I would say Nolasco is still the clear favorite , but say Volquez pitches a gem , would Mattingly make the switch ? I 'm not so sure , it 's something to keep in mind . Mattingly did say after Wednesday 's game that he 's not concerned about Nolasco , and perhaps he 's being completely honest . It 's just a shame how bad Nolasco 's timing is , as the last thing the Dodgers need is to be in a must-win game with a guy on the mound they lack confidence in . But then again , the Dodgers may not have any other choice than to take their chances . We will see .

C	Football season is in full swing . The Broncos are good , the Jaguars are terrible . Enough of that . The NBA season is just around the corner , which means we are thisclose to the sweet spot on the calendar with the NFL , college football , MLB playoffs , AND pro and college basketball going on . Oh yeah , and hockey . I 'm lightheaded . Going into any NBA season , there are really only a handful of true contenders . This year is no different . Several teams are making the path even easier for the good teams by actively tanking for ( by all accounts ) the best draft in years . Any list of contenders has to have the Miami Heat at the top . They are the two-time defending champions , and they still have the best player in the world ( sorry , Laker/Kobe fans , it 's true ) . Well I got my Miss Cleo on recently , and I 'm here to tell you why the Heat will not repeat this season . Let 's take a look in the crystal ball : The East is loaded - For years , the Western Conference in the NBA had seemingly every good player . While 45 + win teams were missing the playoffs out west , sub .500 teams were going through the motions in the playoffs in the L'Eastern Conference . Such was life . Over time , though , that balance of power shifted , and the teams in the East collectively got their shit together . This year there are four ( and a possible ) teams with a shot at the Eastern Conference title . Miami , Chicago , Indiana , Brooklyn , and the-Knicks-if-things-go-right could all make their way to the Finals . Of course , that means some of these teams will beat each other in the playoffs . It also means Miami will have their toughest road through the first three rounds of the playoffs . Chicago added Derrick Rose , their former MVP , and you know he 's rested . Indiana added an actual bench this season , a move that `` rises the tide '' for their team by eliminating the HUGE dropoff when the starters rest . Brooklyn added the best ( and worst ) part of the Celtics roster , and can go 10 deep through the season . And the-Knicks-if-things-go-right will be a better version of last year 's team . If health and threes are on their side , they can beat anyone . This is the best the East has been in years going into the season . Bad news for Miami . Dwyane Wade 's knee - A storyline for the past two seasons , Wade 's knee is a year older with no viable back up to pick up the slack if things fall apart . Ray Allen is next in line , but he 's a really good role player at this point . We have seen the impact of a diminished Wade at various points the past two seasons . While the Heat won the past two seasons , they were pushed to the brink of elimination twice , rescued only when Wade overcame the pain . Recent history shows the Heat can win with a limping Wade . Again , they are the two-time champs . But Wade 's knee is a sucker bet in Vegas . Works great when you hit it , but it 's too risky long term . It 's ridiculously hard to Three Peat - As stated above , only a few of the 30 NBA teams have a legitimate shot to win the title . This year , me and Miss Cleo see eight and a half teams with true title hopes this season ( the 4.5 in the East , plus the LA Clippers , San Antonio Spurs , Oklahoma City Thunder , and Houston Rockets ) . That gives each team a roughly 12 % shot at winning it all . Miami defied the odds twice already , playing the odds suggest they wo n't do it again . Only the Bulls ( twice ) and the Lakers have done it since anyone reading this has been alive . Is the LeBron/Wade duo as dominant as Jordan/Pippen or Kobe/Shaq ? Time will tell , but the crystal ball tells me no. - What do you think ? Will Miami Three Peat ? Stay tuned next week for my Finals prediction !

C	Pteropus phaeocephalus . Credit : Original lithograph by Edwin Wilson '' > Enlarge The illustration that accompanied Thomas 's ( 1882 ) description of Pteropus phaeocephalus . Credit : Original lithograph by Edwin Wilson A specimen preserved in a jar of alcohol in The Natural History Museum , London has remained the only record of the Mortlock Islands flying fox , one of the least known bat species on the planet , for over 140 years . That is until now . A team of bat biologists led by Dr. Don Buden from the College of Micronesia has collected new information about this `` forgotten '' species , and studied it in the wild for the first time . The study is reported today in the open access journal The original London specimen was collected in 1870 from the remote Mortlock Islands , a series of low-lying atolls and part of the Federated States of Micronesia in the west-central Pacific Ocean . British biologist Oldfield Thomas used this specimen to name the species Pteropus phaeocephalus in 1882 . However , information uncovered by Dr. Buden proves that a German naturalist , voyaging on a Russian Expedition , got there first . `` We found a report written by F.H. Kittlitz in 1836 describing his expedition to the Pacific Islands in the late 1820s . In that report he describes the flying-foxes of the Mortlocks and names them Pteropus pelagicus . This means the species was named long before Thomas 's description in 1882 '' said Buden . According to internationally established rules for naming animals , the earliest available scientific name of a species must be officially adopted , so the Mortlock Islands flying fox is now correctly known as Pteropus pelagicus . Not only does Kittlitz correctly deserve credit for the discovery of the species , 50 years earlier than previously thought , but he can also be now credited for the `` new '' name . Furthermore , Buden and colleagues demonstrated that flying foxes from the nearby islands of Chuuk Lagoon , long regarded as a separate species ( Pteropus insularis ) , are also best regarded as a subspecies of Pteropus pelagicus , showing that the species has a wider geographic distribution than previously realized . New fieldwork in the Mortlock Islands revealed more than name changes . The ZooKeys article describes the first study of the behavior , diet , and conservation status of this flying fox , finding that the Mortlock Islands support a small population of 900 to 1200 bats scattered across a land surface of only 12 km2 ( 4.6 square miles ) . Legal rules have brought better protection to the species , which was once heavily hunted . But the future of the species is still uncertain in its island home . Rising sea levels , generated by climate change , threaten the flying foxes ' habitat and food resources through flooding , erosion , and contamination of freshwater supplies . `` This remarkable study shows how much we have to learn about Pacific Islands mammals , `` said Prof. Tim Flannery of Macquarie University in Sydney , who was not involved in the research . `` Where there was darkness , Dr. Buden and colleagues have shed light .

F	"My Kids Don't Do That!" Nationwide Survey Finds Parents In Denial About Teens Driving Distracted | Ulitzer
C	Oct. 22 , 2013 / PRNewswire / -- From texting and checking social media to changing music and talking with friends , teens admit to driving distracted at a much higher rate than their parents realize , a recent nationwide survey shows . The study , commissioned by Bridgestone Americas , found that parents significantly underestimated the driving distractions in which their teen engages . Teens are almost 25 percent more likely to engage in common distractions , such as socializing with passengers , and talking on cell phones than their parents assume . For instance , almost 85 percent of teens admit to driving distracted because they were socializing with passengers , yet only 59 percent of parents suspect that their teen driver has been distracted by passengers in the car . The tire manufacturer surveyed more than 2,000 parents of teen drivers and found : Only 39 percent of parents think their teen driver talks on the phone while driving , yet half of all young drivers admit to doing so . A quarter of parents believe their young driver texts behind the wheel , although twice that number of teens admit to texting and driving . `` What we 're seeing is that parents misjudge how prevalent many of these distracted driving behaviors are and how often their child participates in these activities , '' said Angela Patterson , Manager , Teens Drive Smart Program , Bridgestone Americas . `` Not only are teens engaging in these behaviors more than they know , teens are actually picking up these distracted driving behaviors from their parents . The study clearly showed that distracted driving behaviors are hardly limited to our youngest drivers . Nearly all parents claim that participating in distracted behaviors while driving is unacceptable , yet 94 percent of parents admit to driving distracted anyway . Not only do parents admit their own engagement with distracted driving , they also dramatically overestimate their own driving skills . Nearly every parent surveyed believed they were an average driver and two-thirds believed they were above average drivers . More than 70 percent of parents felt that they are safer drivers compared to everyone else on the road . In a separate teen driver study released by Bridgestone in April 2013 , two-thirds of teens said that they model their driving habits after their parents . Between the two surveys , these studies show that teens have observed their parents engaging in distracting behavior behind the wheel at higher rates than their parents admit . While 44 percent of parents admit to talking on a cell phone , 60 percent of teens said they witnessed their parent chatting behind the wheel . Bridgestone has been working to bring awareness to distracted driving for nearly a decade through its annual Teens Drive Smart Video Contest and Teens Drive Smart Driving Experience .

As advanced data storage, access and analytics technologies aimed at handling\nhigh-volume and/or fast moving data all move center stage, aided by the Cloud Computing boom,\nCloud Expo is the single most effective event for you to learn how to use you own enterprise\ndata - processed in the Cloud - most effectively to drive value for your business.</span>\n<br />\n<br />\nThere is little doubt that Big Data solutions will have an increasing role in the Enterprise\nIT mainstream over time. Get a jump on that rapidly evolving trend at Big Data Expo, which we\nare introducing in November at Cloud Expo Silicon Valley.\n<br />\n<br />\n Cloud Expo was announced on February 24, 2007, the day the term "cloud computing" was coined.\nThat same year, the first C\n<span class="style4">loud Expo t</span>ook place in New York City with 450 delegates. Next\nNovember, Cloud Expo is returning to Silicon Valley with more than 10,000 delegates and over\n600 sponsors and exhibitors.\n<br />\n<br />\n"Cloud" has become synonymous with "computing" and "software" in two short years. Cloud Expo\nis the new PC Expo, Comdex, and InternetWorld of our decade. By 2012, more than 50,000\ndelegates per year will participate in Cloud Expo worldwide.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe cloud is certainly a compelling alternative to running all applications within a\ntraditional corporate data center. But moving from theory into practice is where things get\ncomplicated, and this is where attending a top industry event like Cloud Expo comes in.\n<br />\n<br />\nNo one can take full advantage of cloud computing without first becoming familiar with the\nlatest issues and trends, which is why the organizing principle of the 13th Cloud Expo on\nNovember 4-7, 2013 - is to ensure - through an intensive four-day schedule of keynotes,\ngeneral and breakout sessions, and our bustling Expo Floor - that attending delegates leave\nthe Santa Clara Convention Center with abundant resources, ideas and examples they can apply\nimmediately to leveraging the Cloud, helping them to maximize performance, minimize cost and\nimprove the scalability of their Enterprise IT endeavors.\n<br />\n<br />\nDelegates will leave Cloud Expo with dramatically increased understanding the entire scope of\nthe entire cloud computing spectrum from storage to security.\n<br />\n<br />\nWhether you're an enterprise or small to medium business, you'll soon be benefiting from the\nCloud. Join your peers in Santa Clara November 4-7, and maximize those benefits already in\n2013.

F	Burmanet ? The Irrawaddy: Security in, spitting out for SEA games
C	News At the entrance to the new Wunna Theikdi sports complex in Naypyidaw , an array of soldiers and police peer into the taxi , taking turns to fire off questions . `` Excuse me sir , where are you going ? '' `` Do you have business here ? '' `` The Games do not start for more than a month . '' A 10-minute huddle of conversations and phone calls later , entry to the complex is granted , but only after The Irrawaddy can confirm that interviews have been lined up inside . The Wunna Theikdi venue is a gleaming new complex of indoor and outdoor stadia-all purpose-built for the Southeast Asian Games , a biennial regional athletics and sports competition . A 15-minute drive from Naypyidaw 's main hotel area , the complex is a half-mile uphill and accessed by a six-lane roadway , the entrance to which is gated like a government compound . `` It was much easier to get in a few weeks ago , '' said Khin Maung Kywe , construction director at Max Myanmar , the conglomerate given the job of building the Wunna Theikdi complex . `` Now the guards are very careful before someone comes in , '' he told The Irrawaddy , speaking in the front lobby of the main stands at the new Chinese-designed , 30,000-seat Wunna Theikdi track and field stadium , where the SEA Games opening ceremony will be held . In October , several small bombs went off around Burma , killing three people . The explosions were blamed on a disgruntled splinter element within the Karen National Union ( KNU ) , an ethnic militia that signed a ceasefire with the Burma government in early 2012 after more than six decades of war . Since then , Khin Maung Kywe said , security around the Games venues has been tightened-precautions against repeat attacks before or during the Dec. 11-22 SEA Games , which come right in the middle of the peak tourism season . The 2013 SEA Games will be the competition 's 27th iteration , but will be the first time Burma has hosted the tournament since 1969 . The Games will wind-up just days before the start of Burma 's 2014 chairing of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( Asean ) , a 10-country regional bloc . The one-year leadership post culminates in a major summit involving leaders from China , Japan , India and the United States , meaning any security breach at the SEA Games will be taken seriously at the international level . Competing countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines have voiced concerns about possible security threats during the Games , but have stopped short of saying they will not participate . Following the blasts , Malaysia 's Youth and Sports Minister Khairy Jamaluddin told Malaysian media in October that `` we will evaluate the security situation there before we send out athletes . For now , we are sticking to our original plan to send a contingent to the Games . '' The SEA Games organizing committee has a security section overseen by Burma 's Home Affairs Ministry , and Myat Thura Soe , international relations secretary at the Myanmar National Olympic Committee , told The Irrawaddy that he was confident that the Games would pass without any security breach or worse-and without overly zealous checks slowing up the tens of thousands of spectators expected to attend the events over the course of the Games . `` Even without the recent bombs , security was a key focus for us , '' he said . `` Security is always a major issue for sporting competitions , ever since Black September at the Munich Olympics , '' he added , referring to the murder of 11 Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists at the 1972 Summer Olympics in the former West Germany . As well as `` suspicious packages '' and similar verbiage lifted from the security wonk lexicon , officials will be on the lookout for other , less-deadly public order transgressions at the upcoming SEA Games . Millions of Burmese chew betel nut , a mild stimulant said to increase alertness . In Rangoon and elsewhere across Burma , it is common to see betel nut-chewing taxi drivers and street vendors-their teeth stained red like a hapless boxers ' - expelling reddened gobs of phlegm and saliva across the city 's fractured pavements . But those Burmese fond of a chew and spit will have to kick the habit , temporarily at least , when inside the pristine new Wunna Theikdi compound .

'' A new Hallmark holiday ornament shaped like a sweater features the phrase `` Don we now our FUN apparel '' instead of the traditional `` gay apparel . '' Social conservatives and liberals alike took issue with the move and accused Hallmark of everything from rampant political correctness to homophobia to plain stupidity . Here 's a pretty representative sample of the comments Hallmark 's received : October 31 , 2013 You ca n't buy that kind of publicity . ( But you sure wind up paying for it . ) The company initially offered this defense : `` When the lyrics to ` Deck the Halls ' were translated from Gaelic and published in English back in the 1800s , the word ` gay ' meant festive or merry . Today it has multiple meanings , which we thought could leave our intent open to misinterpretation . ... So the planning team decided to say what we meant : ` fun . ' That 's the spirit we intended and the spirit in which we hope ornament buyers will take it . '' That response did n't help matters , and it actually drew fresh cries of outrage along the lines this user comment on Hallmark 's Facebook page : `` Stop Lying Hallmark ! The only people thinking of the word gay as negative is Hallmark . '' Yesterday , as the issue continued to build steam , Hallmark issued this apology : `` We 've been surprised at the wide range of reactions expressed about the change of lyrics on this ornament , and we 're sorry to have caused so much concern . We never intend to offend or make political statements with our products and in hindsight , we realize we should n't have changed the lyrics on the ornament .

T	Clerical Whispers : Catholic Church Settles Sex Abuse Case
F	Clerical Whispers: Catholic Church Settles Sex Abuse Case
C	The Roman Catholic Church has settled a case involving a priest accused of sexually abusing a young boy at a Chicago parish . The archdiocese has agreed to pay the now 20-year-old man $ 2.3 million in the case involving former priest Daniel McCormack , which was scheduled to go to trial in the spring . The church also agreed to release their records in the case , along with the records of 30 other cases involving Catholic priests . `` There is no closure for this community and the safety of the kids until all the secrets of the past are revealed , '' attorney Jeff Anderson said . McCormack is currently behind bars and listed as a sexually violent predator after pleading guilty in 2007 to sexually abusing boys at St. Agatha Parish where he was the pastor . A year later the archdiocese reached a $ 12.6 million settlement with 16 survivors of clergy sexual abuse , two of whom claim to have been molested by McCormack . In 2011 , the archdiocese agreed to pay $ 3.2 million to another man , who was abused by McCormack between the ages of 10 and 12 . More victims could still come forward . `` He , and all the other men and woman who have broken the silence and have the courage to take on the Archdiocese , expose their offenders and do something to protect other kids in the community , '' attorney Jeff Freeman said . When the records in the cases against McCormack and the others are released , attorneys say it 's possible that criminal cases could be brought against those who knowingly hid abusive priests within the Catholic Church . `` We are going to do everything in our power to honor these survivors in these settlements , that the Archdiocese has pledged when we made these settlements . If not , we will sue them again , '' Freeman said . The Chicago Archdiocese released a statement Tuesday confirming that is has reached multiple victims of sexual abuse over the past two years . Officials say most of the cases discussed Tuesday are several decades old , and that no priest with even one credible allegation of abuse is in active ministry . Church officials say they are cooperating with the attorneys on preparing the records for not only the 30 agreed-upon cases , but also another 30 cases as well . The records are expected to be released in January .

T	Lawmakers put finishing touches on spending bill
F	Lawmakers put finishing touches on spending bill
C	WASHINGTON ( AP ) -- After weeks of secretive work , senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill are trying to put the finishing touches on a $ 1.1 trillion spending bill that would lay to rest last year 's budget battles . The goal is to finish writing the mammoth measure this week in anticipation of House and Senate votes before a Jan. 15 deadline to avert another government shutdown . The bill fills in thousands of details across the approximately one-third of the federal budget devoted to the day-to-day operations of federal agencies . It follows up on the budget pact negotiated by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray , D-Wash , as the anticlimax to a 16-day partial government shutdown in October . A fresh battle over increasing the so-called debt limit looms next month , however , even as the threat of a second government shutdown fades . The budget deal , which easily passed the House and Senate last month , traded longer-term spending cuts and some fee increases for short-term relief from last year 's automatic spending cuts . The process could be compared to building a house : Last month 's deal laid the foundation ; this month , the House and Senate appropriations committees build the frame , put up the walls and finish the interior . The measure includes everything from fighting the spread of the Asian carp into the Great Lakes , ordering new F-35 fighter planes and funding health research to fighting wildfires , sending aid to Israel and Egypt , and helping local governments build sewer systems . The spending is allocated line by line . Appropriations committee aides worked pretty much nonstop over the Christmas-New Year 's holiday break putting it all together . Even by the opaque standards of the appropriators , the numbers crunching the past three weeks has been remarkably secretive . The negotiations promise to produce a foot-tall omnibus spending measure for the 2014 budget year that began in October that 'll total about $ 1.1 trillion after $ 86 billion or so in war funding is tacked on to $ 1.012 trillion for core agency operations . That 's $ 25 billion above fiscal 2013 , when automatic spending cuts known as sequestration slashed $ 64 billion from a massive appropriations bill that passed in March . But it is $ 45 billion higher than what would have been available had the budget talks fallen apart and forced a second full year of sequestration . But the glass-half-empty view is that this appropriated spending in 2014 will be more than $ 30 billion below what was originally contemplated for 2013 and $ 46 billion below levels contemplated in the 2011 budget deal . And the even flusher times when Democrats controlled Congress are a fading memory . Liberals are bracing for shortfalls in subsidized housing and heating aid for the poor . `` I 'm not happy with it and neither is ( Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Barbara ) Mikulski , '' said Sen. Tom Harkin , D-Iowa , who chairs an Appropriations subcommittee that produces a huge measure funding the Labor , Health and Human Services , and Education departments . `` None of us ( appropriators ) are very happy , but it 's better than the sequester . '' Conservatives , likewise , are n't happy that the measure funds the implementation of President Barack Obama 's health care overhaul and agencies responsible for issuing and enforcing new financial regulations . Supporters of the military , meanwhile , are grateful for relief from another $ 20 billion round of automatic cuts in defense spending . The Pentagon 's core budget will remain essentially flat at $ 520 billion , with just a $ 2 billion increase over the post-sequestration level for 2013 that caused furloughs , harmed readiness and slowed weapons procurement . `` They are just looking for some predictability , stability , '' said Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen , R-N.J. , chairman of the House subcommittee that writes the Pentagon 's budget . `` I think we have it . '' Successful action would cap a remarkably dysfunctional year for the appropriations process , which used to dominate the House and Senate floors every summer as lawmakers worked long hours and full weeks banging out the annual bills , voting on hundreds of amendments and debating numerous policy provisions on topics spanning abortion , environmental regulations and annual cost-of-living pay increases for lawmakers . `` There are people who will start their eighth year in the Senate this January who have never seen this process work anywhere close to the right way one time , '' said Sen. Roy Blunt , R-Mo . Lawmakers are used to complaining about omnibus spending bills that short-circuit the process and leave senators and House members who do n't sit on the appropriations panels on the outside looking in . But this year 's experience has been so dysfunctional that the upcoming omnibus is viewed by some as a triumph . `` We can appropriate again ! '' said Sen. Dick Durbin , D-Ill. , a Senate appropriator . It 's clear , however , that the appropriations committees have lost some of their powers . They 're no longer able to `` earmark '' pet projects like roads and bridges , economic development initiatives or grants to local governments into the bills because of a ban engineered by House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio . That makes it harder to build support for their bills . And the spending cutbacks since Republicans took back the House leave little room for new initiatives that allow them to put their stamp on agencies . Instead , the two dozen appropriations subcommittee chairmen , once referred to as `` cardinals '' because of their power over the purse and ranking minority members , now spend a lot of effort troubleshooting and filling holes .

H	<span class="entry-content"><img\nsrc="http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/AP/RWS/hosted.ap.org/MAI/V9823-2014-01-07T0833Z/E/prod/AT/A"\nheight="1" width="1" alt="" /></span>\n<p class="ap-story-p">WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weeks of secretive work, senior lawmakers on\nCapitol Hill are trying to put the finishing touches on a $1.1 trillion spending bill that\nwould lay to rest last year's budget battles.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">The goal is to finish writing the mammoth measure this week in\nanticipation of House and Senate votes before a Jan. 15 deadline to avert another government\nshutdown. The bill fills in thousands of details across the approximately one-third of the\nfederal budget devoted to the day-to-day operations of federal agencies.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">It follows up on the budget pact negotiated by House Budget Committee\nChairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash, as\nthe anticlimax to a 16-day partial government shutdown in October. A fresh battle over\nincreasing the so-called debt limit looms next month, however, even as the threat of a second\ngovernment shutdown fades.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">The budget deal, which easily passed the House and Senate last month,\ntraded longer-term spending cuts and some fee increases for short-term relief from last year's\nautomatic spending cuts. The process could be compared to building a house: Last month's deal\nlaid the foundation; this month, the House and Senate appropriations committees build the\nframe, put up the walls and finish the interior.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">The measure includes everything from fighting the spread of the Asian\ncarp into the Great Lakes, ordering new F-35 fighter planes and funding health research to\nfighting wildfires, sending aid to Israel and Egypt, and helping local governments build sewer\nsystems. The spending is allocated line by line. Appropriations committee aides worked pretty\nmuch nonstop over the Christmas-New Year's holiday break putting it all together.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">Even by the opaque standards of the appropriators, the numbers crunching\nthe past three weeks has been remarkably secretive. The negotiations promise to produce a\nfoot-tall omnibus spending measure for the 2014 budget year that began in October that'll\ntotal about $1.1 trillion after $86 billion or so in war funding is tacked on to $1.012\ntrillion for core agency operations.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">That's $25 billion above fiscal 2013, when automatic spending cuts known\nas sequestration slashed $64 billion from a massive appropriations bill that passed in March.\nBut it is $45 billion higher than what would have been available had the budget talks fallen\napart and forced a second full year of sequestration.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">But the glass-half-empty view is that this appropriated spending in 2014\nwill be more than $30 billion below what was originally contemplated for 2013 and $46 billion\nbelow levels contemplated in the 2011 budget deal. And the even flusher times when Democrats\ncontrolled Congress are a fading memory. Liberals are bracing for shortfalls in subsidized\nhousing and heating aid for the poor.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">"I'm not happy with it and neither is (Senate Appropriations Committee\nChairwoman Barbara) Mikulski," said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who chairs an Appropriations\nsubcommittee that produces a huge measure funding the Labor, Health and Human Services, and\nEducation departments. "None of us (appropriators) are very happy, but it's better than the\nsequester."</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">Conservatives, likewise, aren't happy that the measure funds the\nimplementation of President Barack Obama's health care overhaul and agencies responsible for\nissuing and enforcing new financial regulations.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">Supporters of the military, meanwhile, are grateful for relief from\nanother $20 billion round of automatic cuts in defense spending. The Pentagon's core budget\nwill remain essentially flat at $520 billion, with just a $2 billion increase over the\npost-sequestration level for 2013 that caused furloughs, harmed readiness and slowed weapons\nprocurement.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">"They are just looking for some predictability, stability," said Rep.\nRodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., chairman of the House subcommittee that writes the Pentagon's\nbudget. "I think we have it."</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">Successful action would cap a remarkably dysfunctional year for the\nappropriations process, which used to dominate the House and Senate floors every summer as\nlawmakers worked long hours and full weeks banging out the annual bills, voting on hundreds of\namendments and debating numerous policy provisions on topics spanning abortion, environmental\nregulations and annual cost-of-living pay increases for lawmakers.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">"There are people who will start their eighth year in the Senate this\nJanuary who have never seen this process work anywhere close to the right way one time," said\nSen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">Lawmakers are used to complaining about omnibus spending bills that\nshort-circuit the process and leave senators and House members who don't sit on the\nappropriations panels on the outside looking in. But this year's experience has been so\ndysfunctional that the upcoming omnibus is viewed by some as a triumph.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">"We can appropriate again!" said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., a Senate\nappropriator.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">It's clear, however, that the appropriations committees have lost some\nof their powers. They're no longer able to "earmark" pet projects like roads and bridges,\neconomic development initiatives or grants to local governments into the bills because of a\nban engineered by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. That makes it harder to build support\nfor their bills.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">And the spending cutbacks since Republicans took back the House leave\nlittle room for new initiatives that allow them to put their stamp on agencies. Instead, the\ntwo dozen appropriations subcommittee chairmen, once referred to as "cardinals" because of\ntheir power over the purse and ranking minority members, now spend a lot of effort\ntroubleshooting and filling holes.</p>\n<p class="ap-story-p">In fact, Mikulski, D-Md., was third in line to take the Appropriations\ngavel after former Chairman Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, died a year ago. Harkin and Sen. Patrick\nLeahy, D-Vt., preferred to keep their chairmanships of the Judiciary and Health, Education,\nLabor and Pensions committees, respectively.</p>

C	If the English accent is a major turn on for you , then you could n't get more of a typical quintessential English accent than our newest recruit Jack , if the accent is enough to do it for you , then once this handsome young man peels himself out of his clothes his massive nine inch cock is simply going to knock you sideways . Jack is a free lance artist who lives and works in London , he is very well travelled and enjoys taking in the cultures and history of other parts of the world . He confesses that he is a bit of an exhibitionist , and this really shows in his film , and judging by what he is packing downstairs no wonder he likes to take his kit off ! Anyway , more about his film , after the short chat about life Jack stands and strips to reveal one very large flaccid cock , he plays with it for a matter of seconds and it grows into one very impressively large cock , especially for his slight frame . He jerks off first sat where he slowly works his foreskin over his large cock head , then kneels on the sofa again jerking off at his own pace , admitting to liking to give and receive he turns to show off a very tight looking hair free hole , teasing his hole as he wanks , before settling back on the sofa ,

BEIRUT / / The head of Al Qaeda 's wing in Syria has given rival Islamist militants five days to accept mediation to end their infighting or face a war that `` will terminate them '' , according to an audio recording posted on Tuesday . Abu Mohammed Al Golani , leader of Jabhat Al Nusra , called on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant ( Isil ) group to agree to arbitration by religious scholars to end more than a year of feuding that has turned violent in some areas in Syria . Heavy clashes between the two groups and other Islamist fighters in rebel-held northern and eastern Syria have led to hundreds of deaths and have undermined the wider military campaign against President Bashar Al Assad 's forces . `` We will wait for five days from the date of this recording for your formal reply , '' Golani said in the audio tape , released on an Islamist website . `` By God , if you reject God 's ruling again and do not put an end to your plague against the Umma ( Muslim nation ) , then the Umma will launch an assault against this ignorant ideology and will terminate it , even from Iraq , '' he said .

The commander of Iran 's Northern Navy Fleet , Admiral Afshin Rezayee Haddad , said the vessels have already entered the Atlantic Ocean via waters near South Africa , the official IRNA news agency reported . The fleet , consisting of a destroyer and a helicopter-carrying supply ship , began its voyage last month from the southern Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas . The ships , carrying some 30 navy academy cadets for training along with their regular crews , are on a three-month mission . The voyage comes amid an ongoing push by Iran to demonstrate its ability to project power across the Middle East and beyond . IRNA quoted Haddad as saying the fleet is approaching U.S. maritime borders for the first time . The Islamic Republic considers the move as a response to U.S. naval deployments near its own coastlines . The U.S. Navy 's 5th fleet is based in Bahrain , just across the Persian Gulf .

The ships, carrying\nsome 30 navy academy cadets for training along with their regular crews, are on a three-month\nmission.</p>\n<p>The voyage comes amid an ongoing push by Iran to demonstrate its ability to project power\nacross the Middle East and beyond.</p>\n<p>IRNA quoted Haddad as saying the fleet is approaching U.S. maritime borders for the first\ntime. The Islamic Republic considers the move as a response to U.S. naval deployments near its\nown coastlines. The U.S. Navy's 5th fleet is based in Bahrain, just across the Persian\nGulf.</p>

As advanced data storage, access and analytics technologies aimed at handling\nhigh-volume and/or fast moving data all move center stage, aided by the Cloud Computing boom,\nCloud Expo is the single most effective event for you to learn how to use you own enterprise\ndata - processed in the Cloud - most effectively to drive value for your business.</span>\n<br />\n<br />\nThere is little doubt that Big Data solutions will have an increasing role in the Enterprise\nIT mainstream over time. Get a jump on that rapidly evolving trend at Big Data Expo, which we\nare introducing in June at Cloud Expo New York.\n<br />\n<br />\n Cloud Expo was announced on February 24, 2007, the day the term "cloud computing" was coined.\nThat same year, the first C\n<span class="style4">loud Expo t</span>ook place in New York City with 450 delegates. Next\nJune, Cloud Expo is returning to New York with more than 10,000 delegates and over 600\nsponsors and exhibitors.\n<br />\n<br />\n"Cloud" has become synonymous with "computing" and "software" in two short years. Cloud Expo\nis the new PC Expo, Comdex, and InternetWorld of our decade. By 2012, more than 50,000\ndelegates per year will participate in Cloud Expo worldwide.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe cloud is certainly a compelling alternative to running all applications within a\ntraditional corporate data center. But moving from theory into practice is where things get\ncomplicated, and this is where attending a top industry event like Cloud Expo comes in.\n<br />\n<br />\nNo one can take full advantage of cloud computing without first becoming familiar with the\nlatest issues and trends, which is why the organizing principle of the 13th Cloud Expo on June\n10-12, 2014 - is to ensure - through an intensive four-day schedule of keynotes, general and\nbreakout sessions, and our bustling Expo Floor - that attending delegates leave the New York\nConvention Center with abundant resources, ideas and examples they can apply immediately to\nleveraging the Cloud, helping them to maximize performance, minimize cost and improve the\nscalability of their Enterprise IT endeavors.\n<br />\n<br />\nDelegates will leave Cloud Expo with dramatically increased understanding the entire scope of\nthe entire cloud computing spectrum from storage to security.\n<br />\n<br />\nWhether you're an enterprise or small to medium business, you'll soon be benefiting from the\nCloud. Join your peers in New York June 10-12, and maximize those benefits already in 2014.\nSee you in New York!\n<br />\nRegister Now! <br />\n<span class="event-footer-lfc">Save $500 on your "Golden Pass"!

Authorities in Kuala Lumpur have ruled out any lapses in security at Kuala Lumpur international airport before the ill-fated flight departed for the journey in darkness to Beijing early on Saturday morning . This has drawn greater attention to the behavior of the two men travelling on passports stolen on Phuket and their links to a shadowy Iranian intermediary who helped them book their flights through a travel agency in the seedy seaside Thai city of Pattaya . Malaysia 's acting transport minister , Hishammuddin Hussein , defended authorities for not releasing CCTV footage of the men earlier so their identities could more quickly uncovered . '' I do not want to affect the ongoing investigation , '' ' Mr Hishammuddin said . '' Our main focus is to find the aircraft and we do not want to be distracted . '' The men 's travel tickets were arranged through an Iranian man known as Mr Ali who formerly lived in Pattaya and opened a restaurant there but is now believed to be living in Tehran . Pattaya is a known haunt of international criminal networks and there is a thriving racket in stolen and forged passports . Officials in Kuala Lumpur with knowledge of the investigation into the aircraft 's disappearance say there is growing concern about the failure to find any debris from the plane , fuelling speculation an explosion occurred on the Boeing 777 , either from an explosive device or a technical fault . But officials say until wreckage is found no possibility can be excluded , including a hijacking . The plane appeared on radar to turn back before it disappeared . The pilots inexplicably made no distress call . Malaysia Airlines insisted on Monday the plane 's cockpit would have remained locked in compliance with international safety standards with only the pilots able to open it . Airline security experts say that if an explosion caused the plane to crash the device would probably have been smuggled into cargo and either detonated remotely or with a timer . Malaysian officials have appealed for people not to spread rumors about the cause of the flight 's disappearance , saying they are disrupting investigations and causing grief for relatives of the victims . After meeting a delegation from the Chinese government on Monday officials backed away from earlier statements that the two passengers travelling on stolen passports were '' Asian looking . '' They also played down reports from China the men had links to the Chinese Martys ' Brigade , a previously unheard of group that had reportedly claimed responsibility in a statement to some Chinese journalists .

''Our main focus\nis to find the aircraft and we do not want to be distracted.''\n<br />\n<br />\nThe men's travel tickets were arranged through an Iranian man known as Mr Ali who formerly\nlived in Pattaya and opened a restaurant there but is now believed to be living in Tehran.\n<br />\n<br />\nPattaya is a known haunt of international criminal networks and there is a thriving racket in\nstolen and forged passports.\n<br />\n<br />\nOfficials in Kuala Lumpur with knowledge of the investigation into the aircraft's\ndisappearance say there is growing concern about the failure to find any debris from the\nplane, fuelling speculation an explosion occurred on the Boeing 777, either from an explosive\ndevice or a technical fault.\n<br />\n<br />\nBut officials say until wreckage is found no possibility can be excluded, including a\nhijacking.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe plane appeared on radar to turn back before it disappeared. The pilots inexplicably made\nno distress call.\n<br />\n<br />\nMalaysia Airlines insisted on Monday the plane's cockpit would have remained locked in\ncompliance with international safety standards with only the pilots able to open it.\n<br />\n<br />\nAirline security experts say that if an explosion caused the plane to crash the device would\nprobably have been smuggled into cargo and either detonated remotely or with a timer.\n<br />\n<br />\nMalaysian officials have appealed for people not to spread rumors about the cause of the\nflight's disappearance, saying they are disrupting investigations and causing grief for\nrelatives of the victims.\n<br />\n<br />\nAfter meeting a delegation from the Chinese government on Monday officials backed away from\nearlier statements that the two passengers travelling on stolen passports were ''Asian\nlooking.''\n<br />\n<br />\nThey also played down reports from China the men had links to the Chinese Martys' Brigade, a\npreviously unheard of group that had reportedly claimed responsibility in a statement to some\nChinese journalists.\nPhuket Motorcycle Renter Tells: How We Gave Italian Man's Passport to a Russian\nPhuket Airport Prisoner Says Fake Passport Fliers Were 'Probably Syrians'\nPassport Trade Hot in Thailand, Missing Flight Investigators Told\nIdentity Theft Tourist Tells: How My Passport Was Given to an Italian Man on Phuket\n'Thriving Stolen Passport Racket' Highlights Phuket Link to Lost Flight\nPhuket, Pattaya at Centre of Probe on Lost Flight's Mystery Passengers\nPhuketWATCH Yingluck Tells of Passports Probe; Phuket, Pattaya Links; TAT Offers Surgery\nPhuket Motorcycle Renter Tells: How We Gave Italian Man's Passport to a Russian\nPhuket Airport Prisoner Says Fake Passport Fliers Were 'Probably Syrians'\nPassport Trade Hot in Thailand, Missing Flight Investigators Told\nThai Navy to Celebrate Birthday as Protesters Object to Defamation Attack on Phuket Media\n'Passport Racket' on Phuket; 239 Lives and Two Identities Stolen; No Interpol Check\nPhuket, Where Tuk-Tuk Drivers and Corruption Rule, Deserves One Last Chance\nIdentity Theft Tourist Tells: How My Passport Was Given to an Italian Man on Phuket\n'Thriving Stolen Passport Racket' Highlights Phuket Link to Lost Flight\nStolen Phuket Passports: Could They Link to the Fate of Malaysia Flight MH370?\nDid Plane Turn Back?; Mystery Passengers Mark Riddle of Fatal Flight; Phuket FC Lose; Reds\nMassing\nMurder Victim in Phuket Drain Could be Missing Kanya, Says Family\nUPDATE Angry Residents' Blockade North of Phuket Wins Promise of Safer Road\nPhuket Murder Hunt Begins After Bound Woman's Body Found by Roadside\nUPDATE Oil Slick First Sign of Fate of Missing MAS Flight With 239 on Board\nPhuket Tourist Triggers Arrest Over 130,000 Baht Spend on 'Lost' Debit Card\nBangkok Gives Peace a Chance; Aussies Find Better Phuket; Traffickers Go South\nDrop Phuket Court Action Over Boatpeople Abuses, Human Rights Watch Urges Thaiand

C	Want more real-time San Francisco 49ers news ? Use your ? ? ( arrow ) keys to browse the slideshow San Francisco 49ers have several crucial personnel decisions to make as they embark on rebuilding their roster for the 2014 season . The 49ers will benefit from a $ 10 million increase in the 2014 salary cap , giving them a little more money to work with . All teams benefit , but for 49ers general manager Trent Baalke , this extra money is extremely important . Going from a position where he had very little room to maneuver , the additional $ 10 million gives Baalke and the 49ers some much-needed flexibility . The 49ers locked up one of their own free-agent targets by signing Anquan Boldin to a two-year , $ 12-million contract . They have tough contract decisions to make on several key players , including Donte Whitner , Tarell Brown , and Phil Dawson . They also must address potential extensions for Michael Crabtree and Mike Iupati . At this point , it appears that veterans Jonathan Goodwin and Carlos Rogers have played their final game in a 49er uniform . Although money still is tight and the 49ers will look to build through the draft , they will look outside the organization for cost-effective options to bolster their roster . The key areas that Baalke will need to fortify are cornerback , strong safety and wide receiver . Let 's take a closer look at who might be available and potentially in the 49ers ' price range . Walter Thurmond returns this interception against the Vikings . Seahawks ' Super Bowl run . Thurmond had been starting in place of Brandon Browner at cornerback , but lost his job to Byron Maxwell . He then became expendable , as Maxwell played extremely well in his stead . San Francisco and Seattle have frequently grabbed the other team 's players and this would be a perfect opportunity for the 49ers to do just that . Anything Thurmond could tell the 49ers about the Seahawks ' personnel or their strategies would be an added benefit . In 2013 , Thurmond played in 12 games for the Seahawks , starting three . Even if he is not a starting corner for San Francisco , he is valuable as a nickel or dime back . With the 49ers potentially losing both Carlos Rogers and Tarell Brown , they need an influx of talent at the cornerback position . Look for the 49ers to use one of their first three selections in the upcoming draft on a cornerback , but there still will be a need for more than just the one . If both Rogers and Brown leave , the only returning San Francisco corner that played significant time in 2013 is Tramaine Brock . Chris Culliver returns from an ACL injury , so there 's no telling how he will perform . He had flaws in his game even before his injury . Thurmond just completed a four-year , $ 2.44 million contract . He is in the price range that the 49ers can afford . Richard Marshall started six games last year for the Chargers . Richard Marshall has experience playing both cornerback positions as well as the nickel back . The former San Diego Charger started six games in 2013 , and also received significant playing time as the Chargers ' fifth DB . Marshall is 29 years of age and will be entering his ninth NFL campaign . He made 67 tackles and had three fumble recoveries for the Chargers last season . In 2013 , Marshall made $ 855,000 and will not be overly expensive for the 49ers . Kenny Britt battled injuries in 2013 . Although the San Francisco 49ers signed Anquan Boldin to a two-year , $ 12 million deal , there is still plenty of room for an additional wide receiver or two . Quinton Patton , who was selected in the fourth round of the 2013 draft , showed promise in his rookie season , but had injury issues that caused him to miss several games . Patton played in only six regular season games and caught only three passes . Patton is still a question mark because he has n't proven himself yet . The young receiver looks good , but he also will need to show that he can stay healthy . The 49ers ' also have Michael Crabtree for 2014 , but he is set to become an unrestricted free-agent following this season . If Crabtree departs , another wide receiver would definitely be needed . Kenny Britt had a poor year in 2013 , largely because of a lingering knee injury . Britt caught only 11 passes for 96 yards and was a disappointment . Britt will be entering his sixth NFL season . In three of his five years in the league , Britt caught more than 40 passes . He still has good speed and the ability to get deep . The lingering question is whether Britt can stay healthy over an entire season . Only in his rookie year ( 2009 ) , has Britt been able to play all 16 games of the regular season . Britt is coming off a five-year , $ 9.15 million deal . He had his worst year as a pro in 2013 , so his price tag could be lower than expected . The 49ers need to know whether Britt can stay healthy and produce over an entire season . Because of this uncertainty , they can not offer Britt a big , long-term deal . Major Wright returns this interception against the Steelers . The 49ers selected rookie Eric Reid in the first-round of the 2013 NFL draft . Reid became a starter and should be a top free safety for many years . The strong safety spot was held by Donte Whitner , who is now a free agent . Whitner had a good year and was also very helpful as a mentor to Reid . The issue with Whitner is all about money . He just completed a three-year , $ 11.65 million contract . He is very expensive and will be 29 years of age in July . This means that this could be Whitner 's last shot at a big contract . This will push him out of the 49ers ' price range . Backup safety Craig Dahl can step in , but he is more of a special teams player . If Dahl is the 49ers ' starting strong safety , that signifies a problem in the secondary . The 49ers will likely look to the draft to acquire a young strong safety . However , if Baalke can sign a solid free agent , he should make the deal . Major Wright is the type of player that the 49ers need . In 2013 , Wright made a career-high 79 tackles . He also grabbed two interceptions and forced two fumbles . Wright is three years younger than Whitner and significantly less expensive . He just completed a four-year , $ 3.5 million contract . In his last three seasons , Wright has started 42 regular season games . He missed five games due to injury . Brandon LaFell has played four seasons with the Carolina Panthers . Brandon LaFell had a career-high 49 receptions this past season . He accumulated 627 yards and scored five touchdowns . LaFell has good speed and is young . At age 27 , LaFell is poised for a breakout year . Signing a player like LaFell would also give the 49ers a bit more leverage in their negotiations with Michael Crabtree . LaFell just completed a four-year $ 3.5 million contract . Riley Cooper , another receiver in the same class as LaFell , just signed a five-year , $ 22.5 million deal , with $ 8 million guaranteed . If the 49ers offered LaFell a similar five-year deal , at $ 20 million , with $ 8 million guaranteed , that might be enough to get him into the red and gold . A contract of this duration not only gives the 49ers insurance if Crabtree departs , but also bridges the departure of Anquan Boldin in two years . There are several very good wide receivers coming out in the upcoming draft . Look for the 49ers to select one of them in the second round . This should not preclude them from signing LaFell , as the Crabtree contract negotiations are likely to get contentious .

Klicken Sie oben auf ` Registrieren ' , um den Registrierungsprozess zu starten . Sie k?nnen auch jetzt schon Beitr?ge lesen . Suchen Sie sich einfach das Forum aus , das Sie am meisten interessiert . Vodafone NGN & FritzBox 7390 : Zwei Welten begegnen sich ? ( keine ausg . Gespr?che mehr ) Hallo liebe Forengemeinde , seit etwa 3 Wochen plagt mich hier ein Problem , was ich auch mit Hilfe von Vodafone Hotline & Technik so wie AVM nicht gel?st bekomme . Seit dieser Zeit n?mlich k?nnen wir ?ber die 7390 keine ausgehenden Gespr?che mehr f?hren ; naja ... einer von etwa 70 Versuchen geht dann doch raus ^ ^ Ankommende Rufe aber funktionieren vollkommen schmerzfrei . Wenn ich ins Logfile der FB schaue , sehe ich immer Internettelefonie mit [ hier die Zielnummer]@arcor.de ?ber arcor . de war nicht erfolgreich . Ursache : Temporarily not Available ( 480 ) . Es spielt dabei keinerlei Rolle , ob die Zielnummer im Festnetz oder Mobilnetz liegt , geschweige denn , welcher Anbieter die Zielnummer inne hat . Das Problem besteht auch nach Downgrade der FB-Firmware ( 3 verschiedene Versionen getestet : 84.05.56 , 84.05.54 und 84.05.52 ) so wie nach Installation der aktuellen Beta ( 84.06.04-27435 BETA ) . Aus lauter Verzweiflung habe ich dann heute mal die EasyBox 803 aus der Ecke gekramt , einen Factory-Reset ausgel?st und per MIC neu eingerichtet . Wider Erwarten konnte ich damit ( nachdem ich stundenlang ein analoges Telefon gesucht hatte ) etliche abgehende Verbindungen ohne einen Fehler generieren . Somit konnte ich zumindest die anf?ngliche Vermutung , das die Probleme VF gemacht sind , ausschlie?en ; das Problem mu? m.E. in der FB 7390 liegen ( in Verbindung nat?rlich mit der allseits bekannten , wackeligen VoIP - Implementation bei VF ) ... Ich habe nat?rlich auch mit diversen Einstellungen herum gespielt , wie z.B. den VoIP - Anbieter auf `` andere '' gestellt und alles manuell eingetragen , auch im Wechsel mit IP - Adresse an Stelle von Registrar und/oder Proxy-Server , bei Anschlusseinstellungen Landes - und OKZ ge?ndert ( mit und ohne `` 0 '' , mit und ohne LKZ/OKZ ) . Auch habe ich mit allen anderen Einstellungen getestet ... nichts zu wollen ... so langsam glaube ich , das die SIP - Server bei VF sehen , das da keine EasyBox dran ist und dann in den `` mal Kunden ?rgern '' - Modus schalten Als letzte Aktion heute habe ich mir mal mit FBeditor die Config der einzelnen Rufnummern angesehen , konnte da aber auch nicht mangels Kenntnisse der einzelnen Parameter was auff?lliges entdecken ; ich h?nge mal einen der excl . der Rufnummer identischen Eintr?ge unten an ... Die Antwort auf alles ist leider nicht 42 ; aber wer eine bessere Antwort f?r mich ( und ggf . andere FB - Nutzer ) hat , dem sei jetzt schon einmal inst?ndig gedankt !!! Hier eine der identischen Abschnitte aus FBeditor . username , passwd und name sind nat?rlich bei den anderen Abschnitten anders , ansonsten ist aber alles gleich : Naja du wei?t ja , keinen Support f?r oder bei Fremdhardware . Schick mir mal deine Kundennummer als PN . Und ich schau mal was ich auf unserer Seite sehe . Ich tippe mal auf die FritzBox da AVM bis heute verseumt das Vodafone Profil nach unseren Anforderung auszurichten . Es ist ?ber mehrere Wege an AVM ran getragen wurden , dass die Einstellungen die Sie als Vodafone verkaufen nichts mit Vodafone zu tun haben . Hast du VDSL wenn ja Bitstream oder von VF direkt ? Weil ich bist jetzt nur mal ein Profil f?r ADSL inkl . zweiten PVC entwickelt hatte . Code : voipcfg { dnsport = 7077 ; rtpport_start = 7078 ; sip_srcport = 5060 ; ua1 { enabled = yes ; username = `` blabla '' ; authname = '' '' ; passwd = `` blupblup '' ; registrar = '' 1h ; sipping_enabled = no ; sipping_interval = 280s ; name = '' [ OKZ&TNR ] '' ; providername = '' '' ; ims_client = no ; with_displayname = no ; dtmfcfg = ; rtpevent_keep_packetrate = no ; register_failwait = 3m ; stunserver = '' '' ; stunserverport = 3478 ; use_internat_calling_numb = no ; is_nat_aware = no ; localip = 0.0.0.0 ; protocolprefer = protocolprefer_ipv6 ; ignore_received_header = no ; always_clir = no ; clirtype = clir_rfc3325 ; colptype = colp_none ; clipnstype = clipns_off ; vad_enabled = no ; only_one_dialog = no ; presence_supported = no ; mwi_supported = no ; mwi_inmemoria = no ; ccbs_supported = regsupport_no ; packetization = packetization_fixed ; tx_packetsize_in_ms = 20 ; xrtp_periodic = 0 ; reject_refer = yes ; no_register_fetch = no ; do_not_register = no ; only_call_from_registrar = no ; invite_without_register_allowed = no ; outboundproxy = '' [ OKZ ] . sip . arcor . de '' outboundproxy_without_route_header = yes ; factory_3pty_uri = '' '' ; no_hold_speech = no ; dditype = ddi_from_with_displayname ; ddireception = '' '' ; webui_trunk_id = '' '' ; alias_head_number = '' '' ; cfxsignaling = cfx_standard ; backup_wanted = no ; use_session_timer = no ; use_rport = yes ; add_rtpmap_for_all_codecs = no ; answer_only_one_codec = no ; without_annexb_no = no ; srtp_supported = no ; use_488_for_no_t38 = yes ; g726_via_rfc3551 = no ; no_g726_32_offer_with_pt2 = yes ; g726_fixed_ptime30 = no ; dtmf_inband_on_g711g722 = no ; enable_3xx = yes ; t38_reinvite_from_remote = yes ; use_t38version0 = no ; rtcp_xr_media_attribute = no ; ptime_a_attribute = yes ; tones_and_announcements_for_service = no ; read_p_asserted_identity_header = yes ; route_always_over_internet = yes ; sipiface = sipiface_automatic ; altc_attribute_rfc6947 = no ; gui_readonly = no ; convertstate = 0 ; snmp_instance = 0 ; } Speziell diesen Part f?r alle Vodafone Accounts anpassen : Das sollte die Konfig f?r Public sein . Wenn du ADSL/ADSL2 + / VDSL2 von Vodafone hast w?rde ich empfehlen die Telefonie auf den zweiten VC/VLAN zu verlagern . Hallo , ich k?mpfe mit dem selben Problem - seit ca . 2 Wochen . Vorher lief alles perfekt . Ich habe auch eine 7390 , Fritz OS 6.03 und VDSL50000 und bekomme ebenfalls die Meldung : Internettelefonie mit [ hier die Zielnummer]@arcor.de ?ber arcor . de war nicht erfolgreich . Ursache : Temporarily not Available ( 480 ) . Komischerweise passiert das oft , aber nicht immer . Es gibt Nummern , die kann ich gar nicht mehr anrufen , manche nach ein paar mal probieren . Helpnick , ich habe mal Deine ?nderungen eingepflegt , aber irgendwie hat das meine Voip-Konfig der Fritzbox verhagelt . Ich muss das nochmal ohne Copy/Paste ausprobieren , vielleicht ist da ein falsches Zeichen mit reingerutscht . Kann ich Dir auch mal meine Kundennummer schicken ? Verwende erstmal immer die Vorwahl selbst wenn du im Ortsnetz bist . Fritzbox 7390 mit Vodafone 16000 DSL - VOIP h?ngt sich t?glich aus Alle Zeitangaben in WEZ +1 . Es ist jetzt 23:01

C	Like this story , share it with millions of investors on M3 This region could become China-India gateway F ive Southeast Asia countries are set to bridge China and India - Asia ` s two largest economies - but whether or not they boost economic development remains to be seen , according to analysts at ANZ bank . Cambodia , Laos , Myanmar , Thailand and Vietnam - which ANZ calls the Greater Mekong 5 ( GM-5 ) - have the potential to connect South , Southeast and East Asia , which could help the region become one of the world ` s fastest growing , it said . The GM-5 have a combined population of 300 million , are strategically located and have rich natural resources , but remain underdeveloped and predominantly rural economies , said ANZ . `` Improving the transport connection within the GM-5 should link the varied natural resources of the countries , encourage specialization , develop a supply chain , and ultimately transform the transport corridors into effective economic corridors , '' said the ANZ analysts . Thanks to a plan launched by the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) over 20 years ago , huge progress has been made in improving transport infrastructure to link the more developed urban areas to the inner rural zones and develop the isolated borders as key economic zones . The Transport Master Plan launched in 1995 - by the ADB and other partners - involved the creation of a transport network consisting of three main corridors with several routes . The North-South Economic corridor ( NSEC ) , the East-West Economic Corridor ( EWEC ) and the Southern Economic Corridor ( SEC ) , all oriented toward seaports and giving land-locked countries access to world markets . Success is not guaranteed However , ANZ analysts pointed out that the success of these transport networks hinges on how quickly they can be used to boost trade between the countries . `` Now that the three major transport corridors have been significantly completed , it remains to be seen how fast they will be transformed into arteries of economic activity , '' said ANZ . It ` s not enough to just be physically connected , the analysts said ; the countries need to cultivate cooperative deals at a national level while also rallying community involvement on the ground . The GM-5 have already ratified a Cross-Border Transport Agreement , which is likely to encourage trade between Myanmar , Lao , Thailand , and Vietnam via the EWEC in a first positive step . Now , the extent to which local communities and small businesses engage across borders will be key . `` Access to transport corridors is a necessary but hardly sufficient condition for economic development , '' said ANZ . In the absence of these two elements , ANZ said there is a risk that economic enclaves will emerge leaving local communities isolated on the fringes of the corridors . The SEC , completed in 2006 , includes the Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh Highway Project , a network of arteries from Bangkok through Cambodia reaching destinations along the Vietnamese coast . Meanwhile , the EWEC , also completed in 2006 , is the only direct and continuous land path stretching the Indian Ocean on the west to the Pacific Ocean on the east . It passes through the less populated and poorer areas of Myanmar , Thailand , Laos and Vietnam . Finally the NSEC , a 1,000 kilometer road linking Kunming in China ` s Yunan Province to Bangkok in Thailand , provides entry to the shipping routes in the ASEAN region from Southwestern China to Northern Thailand . This is the first time in history that Southern China has been linked to South East Asia , the bank said . And following on from the Transport Master Plan , the Transport Sector Strategy plan , launched in 2006 is now targeting six further corridors covering most of the GM-5 . According to Eugenia Fabon Victorino , an economist at ANZ who worked on the report , the trade relationships between the GM-5 and China are more developed in contrast to India . She said the routes connecting Bangkok and Southern China are likely to be profitable as Thailand and China have higher gross domestic product compared to the rest of the region .

Photo : supplied Detectives are making a fresh appeal to the public for assistance in to a suspected homicide after learning more about his last known movements . In February 2014 police said the case of missing person Bradley Hugh Hoddy had turned into a homicide investigation . Mr Hoddy , also known as Bradley Hugh Schultz did not have a fixed address and lived what police described as an `` itinerant '' lifestyle , but he made sure he got in touch with his young son for birthdays and special occasions . The last time he contacted his young son was in 2006 and the boy is now nine years old . Advertisement His younger brother , Mr Hoddy 's second son , is now six years old and has never met his father . Mr Hoddy was staying with friends in the northern suburbs at the time of his disappearance . Enquiries have established the last positive sighting of him was at the Warwick Grove Shopping Centre at the corner of Beach Road and Erindale Road in Warwick on August 4 , 2006 . Mr Hoddy 's sister Megan Dunstan broke down as she spoke to media about her brother 's disappearance . `` It 's been really hard not knowing , '' she said . `` We 've had some really major things happen in our family and it would 've been really nice having him around . `` We just want to put him to rest . '' Ms Dunstan said she grieved for him a couple of years ago when she had kids , as she knew he would have been around if he could be . `` We just want somewhere we can lay our brother and the kids can go to and mourn their father . '' Mr Hoddy 's former partner and mother of his two sons Victoria Medlicott said his kids were confused . `` They want answers and they ca n't be given answers , so [ they are ] really confused , '' she said . `` Just let us move on and close that chapter . `` It 's been I do n't know how many years I have n't known what 's been going on , I 've only just recently told them that he has passed away just a few days ago . `` To me it 's not about who hurt him , it 's about putting him to rest that 's the main thing for his children and his family .

C	French President Francois Hollande Thursday condemned the Thai army coup , his office reported in a statement . '' ( Hollande ) calls for an immediate return to constitutional order and the organization of an electoral process , '' Xinhua quoted the statement as adding . The president also called for the respect of Thai people 's fundamental rights and freedoms amid persistent tensions in this Southeast Asia 's second biggest economy . The Thai military Thursday staged a coup d'etat to overthrow an elected government and parliament and abolish the constitution following months of an unresolved political conflict . Under the name of the National Peacekeeping Council , the military seized power and detained protest leaders , caretaker cabinet ministers and leading politicians at an army barracks . It was done after the leaders failed to reach agreement to end the seven-month-long political crisis .

Prashant Bhushan to give home tutions to judges so that they come up with correct verdict Congress to archive 7 RCR and Akash Tablet after archiving PMOIndia Twitter handle Congress claims Modi used glycerine to make himself cry ; BJP still a party with kattar soch Rajnath Singh hails Rahul Mahajan 's contribution in elections ; thanks him for not joining BJP Kiran Bedi may now be eager to become the leader of the Delhi BJP in the Assembly elections , but party leaders resent the bid of an outsider to capitalise on the Modi wave . It is the fear of break in the momentum that makes the Aam Aadmi Party so ill at ease with the idea of settling down to quiet introspection . Most of the credit goes to the team management , they spotted the weak areas and followed up with some brave decisions which played a major part in the turnaround . Here are five reasons behind KKR 's brilliant turnaround this season . Kejriwal was summoned as an accused by the court in the defamation complaint in which Gadkari had alleged that he was defamed by the AAP leader , who had included his name in the party 's list of `` India 's most corrupt '' . We will go to polls , ask people for forgiveness and win them back , '' Arvind Kejriwal said at his press conference . The first two are easily done . The third one will prove far more challenging for AAP for five reasons . Photos : Why we should thank Aishwarya , Sonam for turning up at Cannes So Aishwarya Rai , Sonam Kapoor , Frieda Pinto and Mallika Sherawat turned up at Cannes - pout , supermodel stare , air kisses , Robot wave and can-can et al. . Aishwarya rocked an elaborate , opulent golden Roberto Cavalli number to show Sonam Kapoor that she is the grand Cannes lady of India . Frieda Pinto gave the duo stiff competition too .

H	French President Francois Hollande Thursday condemned the Thai army coup, his office reported\nin a statement.\n<p>"(Hollande) calls for an immediate return to constitutional order and the organization of\nan electoral process," Xinhua quoted the statement as adding.</p>\n<p>The president also called for the respect of Thai people's fundamental rights and freedoms\namid persistent tensions in this Southeast Asia's second biggest economy.</p>\n<p>The Thai military Thursday staged a coup d'etat to overthrow an elected government and\nparliament and abolish the constitution following months of an unresolved political\nconflict.</p>\n<p>Under the name of the National Peacekeeping Council, the military seized power and detained\nprotest leaders, caretaker cabinet ministers and leading politicians at an army barracks.</p>\n<p>It was done after the leaders failed to reach agreement to end the seven-month-long\npolitical crisis.</p>\n<div class="PA20">\n<p class="red PB20">Firstpost encourages open discussion and debate, but please adhere to the\nrules below, before posting.

Here are five reasons\nbehind KKR's brilliant turnaround this season.\n<p>Kejriwal was summoned as an accused by the court in the defamation complaint in which\nGadkari had alleged that he was defamed by the AAP leader, who had included his name in the\nparty's list of "India's most corrupt".</p>\n<p>We will go to polls, ask people for forgiveness and win them back," Arvind Kejriwal said at\nhis press conference. The first two are easily done. The third one will prove far more\nchallenging for AAP for five reasons.</p>\nPhotos: Why we should thank Aishwarya, Sonam for turning up at Cannes\n<p>So Aishwarya Rai, Sonam Kapoor, Frieda Pinto and Mallika Sherawat turned up at Cannes -\npout, supermodel stare, air kisses, Robot wave and can-can et al. Aishwarya rocked an\nelaborate, opulent golden Roberto Cavalli number to show Sonam Kapoor that she is the grand\nCannes lady of India. Frieda Pinto gave the duo stiff competition too. And we should be\nthankful to these ladies, not only for lugging around dresses that look heavier than\nthemselves but for also making lunch breaks more rewarding than stalking the best friend's\nsister-in-law on Facebook.</p>\n<p>At the CWC meet, there were some members who wanted to make their point to the leadership,\nthey wanted to alert the first family of some of the mistakes made in the run up to the 2014\nelections.</p>\n<p>Be it principled position or vote bank politics, Nitish has surely betrayed his voters who\nhad given JD(U)-BJP alliance a historic three-fourth mandate to govern and make Bihar a\ndeveloped state.</p>\n<p>Delhi Daredevils suffered their seventh consecutive loss this IPL season as they went down\nto table-toppers Kings XI Punjab by four wickets in their last game at Feroze Shah Kotla.</p>\n<p>A BJP leader told Firstpost on the condition of anonymity that the first person to take\noath after Narendra Modi is sworn in as the Prime Minister, will be Rajnath Singh.

F	WWE: Monday Night Raw part 73 - Skinny Jean Sellout Appreciation - Page 11 - HFBoards
C	Vince Russo actually has a good take on why the ratings are so low . WWE goes from a family friendly skit of Torito losing his tail to Cena telling Wyatt that payback is a ***** , which is a complete 180 from the previous segment . Networks go after the 18-49 demo ( the main demo ) , but WWE is going after the 5-65 demo , because as Russo puts it , in typical Vince fashion , he wants it all and it just does n't work . He says it 's good in theory to want it all , but in reality , they 've alienated half of their audience because of this . No-that 's a BS excuse . We saw within a five-minute span on `` Raw '' last night why the ratings are HALF of what they used to be . In attempting to obtain ALL-the WWE has literally alienated , or `` turned off '' half their audience in the process . Do n't believe me-see what the IWS community has to say about last night 's `` Raw '' today . Yeah-they loved the Shield brawling with Evolution at the end-but , the baby bull-not so much . And what about the `` families '' ? Oh , yeah , that bull thing was `` cute '' , but John Cena swearing-not so much . Now , if you keep doing this week in , and week out , the things you `` do n't like '' will eventually start to build , or add up-until all of a sudden-it 's OK if we miss `` Raw '' this week .

C	June 23 2014 at 10:14 pm By Tom Hayward AP Sri Lanka batsman Mahela Jayawardene said England failed to handle the pressure on the fourth day of the second and final Test . Photo by : Rui Vieira/AP Leeds , England , - Sri Lanka batsman Mahela Jayawardene said England failed to handle the pressure on the fourth day of the second and final Test on Monday and questioned the way home captain Alastair Cook had handled recent criticism . England , chasing 350 to win , were staring defeat in the face at the close of play on 57 for five after Dhammika Prasad grabbed four wickets during a fiery spell of fast bowling . Earlier , a Test-best 160 from skipper Angelo Mathews helped Sri Lanka amass a second-innings total of 457 after starting the day in a tricky position on 212 for four . `` We 've seen that under pressure they ( England ) are not quite up to it , '' said Jayawardene after having chipped in with a typically cultured knock of 79 . `` They were quite chirpy but they quietened down after the first hour . We know who 's on top and who 's not , '' he told reporters at Headingley . Cook , on the receiving end of a 5-0 Ashes whitewash at the beginning of the year , has been criticised by former Australia great Shane Warne who branded the captain as `` boring '' and `` unimaginative '' . The out-of-form opening batsman made only 16 on Monday and is now without a Test hundred for 24 innings . Former Sri Lanka skipper Jayawardene questioned the way Cook had responded to the recent criticism from Warne who is a regular pundit on Sky Sports television . `` I feel for Alastair but it does n't help arguing with commentators , '' he said . `` That is something you ca n't control . comment guidelines .

F	Review: The House of the Scorpion | Books With Bite
C	Amazon Matteo Alacran was not born ; he was harvested with the DNA from El Patron , lord of a country called Opium . Can a boy who was bred to guarantee another 's survival find his own purpose in life ? And can he ever be free ? This has to one of the first book that has to do with creating children for a while . I can not really remember a book like this and that is what excites me . I understand that this book is one that came out years ago but what is surprising is that I keep seeing it in places that I travel so I figured that this book must be good and after reading it , it was not what I was expecting but it was a book that I enjoyed . This story follows a boy who was created from the DNA from El Patron . The purpose of this boy is to keep his provider alive and healthy . The reader follows what people think of the clone boy , Matteo , and how he goes about changing the country of Opium . For me this book was an exciting read and it somewhat represents how people view other people who are different from them . This is something that we are exposed to in our lives and the actions that some people take are not ones that resemble that of those in this book but the idea of segregating people because they are different is something that we do . Matteo for me was a special character . I loved him because of his curiosity and his willingness to keep going . I would have wanted to pull him from his troubles but I feel what he went through is a representation of struggles that we face . Farmer took a character and gave him a role that made him play a significant role that can impact those who read this book . Chayse Senior in college . Studying English . Works as a tutor . Just wants his days reading and sleeping . Oh what a life that would be . January - $ 197.85 February : $ 169.69 Copyright © Books With Bite 2010-2014 . All Rights Reserved .

C	the doorbell rang I was expecting to be Grant . When it was Jessica Hyde I literally jumped . Haha why ?! It was n't dramatic ! But yes I expected the same as you ! Haha why ?! It was n't dramatic ! But yes I expected the same as you ! Enjoyed it even though I 'm not quite sure what I spent 90 minutes watching . I was expecting the other killer , definitely not Jessica . Very weird , but also very watchable . The Welsh bird 's valleys accent is sexy as hell to me . The torture scene was very good . Certainly interested enough to watch another one . The good thing about British shows like this is that they 'll only have a handful of episodes , and usually just one writer , so the actual story should be solid enough and conclude , rather than a Lost/Flashforward/Heroes like `` feck it , lets just make up some weird mysterious shit and string people along for as long as they 'll keep commissioning us . '' The scene in the lavender ( ? ) field looked stunning . There was absolutely no purpose for it . Like , at all . But I 'm not complaining , ` cos it looked so purdy . Is that the one at the start of the episodes ? Does look good . I think it 's very well directed and shot but there does n't seem to be much happening . In my opinion it 's trying far to hard to be some kind of `` clever '' show when in actual fact there is literally nothing happening . I would n't mind so much but it 's a six parter show and they 've basically used a third of the six parts to introduce characters which could of been done a lot quicker . `` that looks lovely , lets shoot it and then make it look more purple in post ! '' but occasionally those kind of things are worth doing . It basically added to a scene in which nothing was happening anyway . I get your point on the `` clever '' thing . I agree it strikes me as very simplisticly written for something made so deliberately to be cult and quirky . It 's written by the guy who wrote Matilda the Musical though , so it 's not exactly going to be Twin Peaks or Black Mirror , but it does seem to have been produced with the idea of presenting it in that kind of mould . Missed it last night , will need to try and catch it on 4OD . Anyway I 'm fortunate enough not to be a writer so I can enjoy shows for what they are and not look into the details . I enjoy this show . Jessica Hyde is one cool character and I like how she has no remorse and just has that natural will and instinct to survive . Heardy did you miss last nights show ? Anyway I 'm fortunate enough not to be a writer so I can enjoy shows for what they are and not look into the details . I enjoy this show . Jessica Hyde is one cool character and I like how she has no remorse and just has that natural will and instinct to survive . does anyone have a clue what the feck the deal is with the welsh chick ? Who is she Genius , yeah I missed it last night . I got in at 11:20 so missed the start on channel 4 plus one . Genius , yeah I missed it last night . I got in at 11:20 so missed the start on channel 4 plus one . I 'll watch it on 4 on demand tonight if I can . Really enjoyed the first two episodes though .

F	Nachos Grande: In the Beginning there were Four Boxes of Ginter.
C	It 's time . It 's finally time . I had to wait to see if I 'd have any money to order boxes . I had to wait to find a website that was selling boxes cheap enough for me to buy .

Vietnam veterans - ANY branch of military - who received Other Than Honorable ( OTH ) discharge and had/have Post Traumatic Stress may be interested in this : `` The Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale , together with our co-counsel Jenner & Block , is litigating a proposed nation-wide class action to challenge the denial by the record correction boards of nearly all discharge upgrade applications submitted by Vietnam veterans with an OTH and a later diagnosis of PTSD . See Monk v. Mabus , No. 3:14 - cv-00260-WWE ( D. Conn. ) . The government has moved to dismiss claims against the Secretary of the Air Force on the ground that none of our individual named plaintiffs are Air Force veterans . We will make various responses when we file our opposition , but we are interested in identifying specific USAF veterans who served in the Vietnam Theatre , received an OTH , and were later diagnosed with PTSD . We are especially interested in identifying such USAF veterans who have applied one or more times to the AFBCMR to updgrade discharge status and have been denied . If you are aware of any USAF veteran who fits this profile , especially among your current or past clients , please let me know . The proposed class definition is `` all veterans of the Vietnam War Era who served in the Vietnam Theater and : ( a ) were discharged under other than honorable conditions ( also referred to as an undesirable discharge ) ; ( b ) have not received discharge upgrades to honorable or to general ( affirmed under uniform standards ) ; and ( c ) have been diagnosed with PTSD attributable to their military service . '' Michael J. Wishnie , William O. Douglas Clinical Professor of Law and Deputy Dean for Experiential Education , Yale Law School The office stated that any branch of the military to whom this could apply should call for a screening interview for this class action .

C	I 've been pretty discouraged about my attitude lately . Do n't even try to tell me that there 's NOT a spiritual battle going on all around us . My life is living proof that there IS ! Every single day , my flesh is dukin ' it out with the Holy Spirit inside me . My selfish nature wants things MY way ... easy , happy , carefree , no responsibilities , and just plain boring , really . But the Holy Spirit wants me to be challenged , convicted , and empowered to be the woman GOD wants me to be . My attitude has always been my main vessel for sin . Thank you , Jesus , I have a `` simple '' testimony ... no drugs , no alcohol , no sex outside of marriage , no abuse , no `` big-time '' mistakes ... but man , if I 've learned anything about myself over the past few years , it is that I am PRIDEFUL ... I am a WORRIER ... and I am UNGRATEFUL fffaaarrr too often . I 'm also a PERFECTIONIST and a SELF-CONDEMNER , which means that I beat myself to a pulp every time I mess up . I have so much to be thankful for ... I 'm the most blessed person I know ( yes , I 'm bragging ; ) ) . And so I have NO , absolutely NO , reason to have a bad attitude ... especially about frivolous things . I know I 'm human and all that jazz , but I just wanna do better . So I 've been struggling ... wanting to do the right thing , wanting to truly be a good example ( not just look like one on the outside ) , wanting to stop messing up . Hence , my Facebook status recently about feeling like an imposter . Thank you to everyone who posted on my status or sent me a separate message or text . I was humbled to see how many people took a minute to post encouragement for me . And as a response to all the encouraging posts , I wanted to post something special God used in my life this week . I 've been reading through the book Jesus Calling by Sarah Young , and a couple days this week , my readings have been all about facing challenges head on because God is trying to teach us and make us stronger because of them . This one , in particular , spoke to me this week . It says ... `` Do not resist or run from the difficulties in your life . These problems are not random mistakes ; they are hand-tailored blessings designed for your benefit and growth . Embrace all the circumstances that I allow in your life , trusting Me to bring good out of them . View problems as opportunities to rely more fully on Me . When you start to feel stressed , let those feelings alert you to your need for Me . Thus , your needs become doorways to deep dependence on Me and increasing intimacy between us . Although self-sufficiency is acclaimed in the world , reliance on Me produces abundant living in My kingdom . Thank Me for the difficulties in your life , since they provide protection from the idolatry of self-reliance . '' - Jesus Wow ! That just hits what I 'm dealing with right on the head ! I do not rely on the Lord ... I rely on myself ... because I am prideful . The root of my bad attitude is a lack of faith . Faith is denying myself and relying on God . God has been trying to teach me this for so long , and I keep forgetting the many ways He 's been trying to teach me over the past few years especially . I must remember John 15:5 when it says , `` Apart from Me , you can do NOTHING ! '' It 's so true . I need Jesus for the very air I breathe , so why do I think I can sustain a godly , joyful , and thankful attitude for any length of time without His help . If only I could see my failures and difficult circumstances as opportunities to depend on Christ , just like my Jesus Calling reading says . Wow . ... ... I guess I can keep practicing . : ) Practice is one of my life words . I will keep practicing denying myself and relying on Jesus ... I will keep practicing my faith . : )

I need Jesus for the very air I breathe, so why do I think I can sustain a godly,\njoyful, and thankful attitude for any length of time without His help. If only I could see my\nfailures and difficult circumstances as opportunities to depend on Christ, just like my Jesus\nCalling reading says. Wow. ......... I guess I can keep practicing. :) Practice is one of my\nlife words. I will keep practicing denying myself and relying on Jesus ... I will keep\npracticing my faith. :)</div>

C	Salmonella 's Limited Diet Could Be its End Ohio State University ( OSU ) researchers have discovered that salmonella 's appetite and reliance on a single food source could be the bacteria 's downfall . According to an OSU press release , researchers discovered that when the salmonella bacteria ca n't access the nutrient fructose-asparagine , they become 1,000 times less effective at sustaining disease than when they 're fully nourished . The research suggests that blocking activation of one of five genes that transport the nutrient to salmonella cells could be a new strategy to fight infection . `` For some reason , salmonella really wants this nutrient , and if it ca n't get this one , it 's in really bad shape , '' said Brian Ahmer , associate professor of microbial infection and immunity at The Ohio State University and lead author of the study . `` If you could block salmonella from getting that nutrient , you 'd really stop salmonella . '' The research is published in the journal PLOS Pathogens Cool Retaliation Could Hurt U.S. Economy Generally , most of the 42,000 Americans who report salmonella infection annually ride out the gastroenteritis symptoms of diarrhea , fever , stomach cramps and vomiting for four to seven days , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Antibiotics are n't a recommended treatment for most infections because they kill good gut bacteria along with salmonella . Fructose-asparagine is composed of a sugar and amino acid stuck together . Its identification alone is also unusual : `` It has never been discovered to be a nutrient for any organism , '' Ahmer said . Ahmer and colleagues found this important food source by first identifying the genes that salmonella requires to stay alive during the active phase of gastroenteritis , when the inflamed gut produces symptoms of infection . The researchers ran numerous experiments in cell cultures and mice to observe what happened to salmonella in the inflamed gut when these genes were mutated . Under differing conditions , salmonella 's fitness dropped between 100 - and 10,000-fold if it could not access fructose-asparagine , even if all of its other food sources were available . `` That was one of the big surprises : that there is only one nutrient source that is so important to salmonella . For most bacteria , if we get rid of one nutrient acquisition system , they continue to grow on other nutrients , '' Ahmer said . `` In the gut , salmonella can obtain hundreds of different nutrients . But without fructose-asparagine , it 's really unfit . '' Because of that sole source for survival , the genes needed for acquisition of this nutrient could be effective drug targets . `` Nobody 's ever looked at nutrient transporters as drug targets because it 's assumed that there will be hundreds more transporters , so it 's a pointless pursuit , '' Ahmer said . This kind of drug also holds promise because it would affect only salmonella and leave the trillions of other microbes in the gut unaffected . Ahmer and colleagues are continuing this work to address remaining questions , including the window of time in which access to the nutrient is most important for salmonella 's survival as well as identifying human foods that contain high concentrations of fructose-asparagine .

The plans could mean a reduction of about 15 per cent in the overall time that more than 30 libraries across the city are open each week . But the impact of the proposed cutbacks is also likely to vary wildly from site to site . Gildersome , Whinmoor and Scholes libraries could have their opening hours cut by more than 40 per cent . Rothwell 's hours could drop by 28 per cent while Seacroft 's could fall by 22 per cent . Other sites , such as Holt Park , Yeadon , Guiseley , Chapel Allerton and Leeds Central , could escape with reductions of less than 10 per cent . Leeds City Council has launched a consultation process to get the public 's views on its plans . And Leeds West MP Rachel Reeves wants residents in her constituency to stand up and be counted in support of its two libraries , Bramley and Armley . Bramley 's hours could be cut by 18 per cent while Armley 's could come down by 15 per cent . The Bramley site might also close on Thursdays . Ms Reeves said : `` I find it deeply unfair that opening hours at Armley and Bramley should be cut , when we already have fewer libraries in this area than other parts of Leeds . '' A spokesman for the council said the consultation had been launched on the back of work exploring how individual libraries can each provide the most efficient service . He added : `` We would urge anyone who uses our libraries to please make their comments heard through our public consultation , which they can be assured will be fully taken into account before any final decisions are made .

C	CTY implosion30p 08/29/2014 The Blade/Lori King A portion of the last smokestack at the Toledo Edison Power Plant in East Toledo is imploded Friday . Dykon Corporation has been contracted through B&B Wrecking by the City of Toledo to perform the implosion . Buy This Photo The first thought from several spectators after a demolition team took down most of the last smokestack at East Toledo 's old Acme power plant site Friday morning was that what remained was too short . `` I think they messed up , and took out way more than they wanted to , '' said Bill Reece , an East Toledoan who watched the implosion from a field along Front Street , south of where the plant once stood . Not exactly - nobody messed up , at least that 's what both officials from the city and the Oklahoma-based subcontractor that rigged and detonated the stack now say . The implosion was within the tolerances established beforehand . But the result , a city official conceded afterward , was not quite what had been hoped for . `` Unfortunately , we lost some of the height we wanted to maintain , '' economic development director Bill Burkett said . But the 75 feet or so that remains , he said , `` will be stabilized at that height and we go from there . '' At 75 feet , it will be less than half the height that Lisa Ward , spokesman for Mayor D. Michael Collins ' administration , said it would become when initial plans were publicized in mid-June to demolish two other Acme stacks and shorten the biggest one . The city then said that only the top 100 feet would come off the 298-foot stack , making it short enough that its lack of aviation lights would no longer violate federal regulations . But Ms. Ward said Friday that officials subsequently determined that above 100 feet , the 85-year-old brick tower was not stable enough to keep . Spectators gather to watch and record the implosion of a portion of the last smokestack at the Acme power plant along the Maumee River in East Toledo . Buy This Photo A structural report said it would cost the city $ 750,000 to preserve the stack at the taller level , Mr. Burkett said . `` It all came down economically to , ` Let 's leave about 100 feet left , ' '' he said . For the implosion , though , subcontractor Dykon Explosive Demolition Corp. of Tulsa was given 25 feet of leeway either way . Ron Gilbert , Dykon 's project manager , said that was necessary because dismantling old brick structures - especially ones without any as-built engineering documents - is not a precise operation . `` Of course we wanted it to break perfectly and eat our cake too , '' Mr. Gilbert said afterward . But the bottom line , he said , was that the implosion stayed within the specifications , nobody got hurt , `` and the city gets a marvelous '' - he paused - `` whatever . '' City officials would n't say how much they spent for East Toledo 's new `` marvelous whatever . '' The cost came out of a $ 388,000 demolition contract to clean up the site . Mayor Collins has proposed styling the smokestack 's stump to resemble a lighthouse , with a revolving red-and-green lamp atop it to symbolize lights used on boats to indicate port and starboard . Mr. Burkett said Friday , however , that all options remain open - including razing the rest of the structure . Demolition , however , would require money and the approval of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development , which in 2011 provided Toledo with a $ 475,000 grant for site cleanup and historic preservation at the Acme site . The HUD grant , Mr. Burkett said , specified preserving at least part of the smokestack as well as the plant 's guard house , which still stands but has been mothballed . Most of the old power plant , which had been decommissioned in the early 1990s , was razed three years ago , but the stacks remained . The gathering of spectators was appreciably smaller than that which witnessed the two smaller stacks ' July 16 demolitions , but those who showed up still enjoyed themselves . `` I just like seeing things blow up - probably like everyone else , '' said Matt Beil of Whitehouse . `` It was impressive . '' But Rebecca Martinez of East Toledo , who like Mr. Beil had been to both implosions , said the first one was more impressive . Guidelines : Please keep your comments smart and civil .

H	CTY implosion30p 08/29/2014 The Blade/Lori King A portion of the last smokestack at the Toledo\nEdison Power Plant in East Toledo is imploded Friday. Dykon Corporation has been contracted\nthrough B&amp;B Wrecking by the City of Toledo to perform the implosion.\nBuy This Photo    \n<p>The first thought from several spectators after a demolition team took down most of the\nlast smokestack at East Toledo's old Acme power plant site Friday morning was that what\nremained was too short.</p>\n<p>"I think they messed up, and took out way more than they wanted to," said Bill Reece, an\nEast Toledoan who watched the implosion from a field along Front Street, south of where the\nplant once stood.</p>\n<p>Not exactly - nobody messed up, at least that's what both officials from the city and the\nOklahoma-based subcontractor that rigged and detonated the stack now say.</p>\n<p>The implosion was within the tolerances established beforehand.</p>\n<p>But the result, a city official conceded afterward, was not quite what had been hoped\nfor.</p>\n<p>"Unfortunately, we lost some of the height we wanted to maintain," economic development\ndirector Bill Burkett said.</p>\n<p>But the 75 feet or so that remains, he said, "will be stabilized at that height and we go\nfrom there."</p>\n<p>At 75 feet, it will be less than half the height that Lisa Ward, spokesman for Mayor D.\nMichael Collins' administration, said it would become when initial plans were publicized in\nmid-June to demolish two other Acme stacks and shorten the biggest one.</p>\n<p>The city then said that only the top 100 feet would come off the 298-foot stack, making it\nshort enough that its lack of aviation lights would no longer violate federal regulations.</p>\n<p>But Ms. Ward said Friday that officials subsequently determined that above 100 feet, the\n85-year-old brick tower was not stable enough to keep.</p>\nSpectators gather to watch and record the implosion of a portion of the last smokestack at the\nAcme power plant along the Maumee River in East Toledo.\nBuy This Photo    \n<p>A structural report said it would cost the city $750,000 to preserve the stack at the\ntaller level, Mr. Burkett said.</p>\n<p>"It all came down economically to, 'Let's leave about 100 feet left,' " he said.</p>\n<p>For the implosion, though, subcontractor Dykon Explosive Demolition Corp. of Tulsa was\ngiven 25 feet of leeway either way.</p>\n<p>Ron Gilbert, Dykon's project manager, said that was necessary because dismantling old brick\nstructures - especially ones without any as-built engineering documents - is not a precise\noperation.</p>\n<p>"Of course we wanted it to break perfectly and eat our cake too," Mr. Gilbert said\nafterward.</p>\n<p>But the bottom line, he said, was that the implosion stayed within the specifications,\nnobody got hurt, "and the city gets a marvelous" - he paused - "whatever."</p>\n<p>City officials wouldn't say how much they spent for East Toledo's new "marvelous whatever."\nThe cost came out of a $388,000 demolition contract to clean up the site.</p>\n<p>Mayor Collins has proposed styling the smokestack's stump to resemble a lighthouse, with a\nrevolving red-and-green lamp atop it to symbolize lights used on boats to indicate port and\nstarboard.</p>\n<p>Mr. Burkett said Friday, however, that all options remain open - including razing the rest\nof the structure.</p>\n<p>Demolition, however, would require money and the approval of the U.S. Department of Housing\nand Urban Development, which in 2011 provided Toledo with a $475,000 grant for site cleanup\nand historic preservation at the Acme site.</p>\n<p>The HUD grant, Mr. Burkett said, specified preserving at least part of the smokestack as\nwell as the plant's guard house, which still stands but has been mothballed.</p>\n<p>Most of the old power plant, which had been decommissioned in the early 1990s, was razed\nthree years ago, but the stacks remained.</p>\n<p>The gathering of spectators was appreciably smaller than that which witnessed the two\nsmaller stacks' July 16 demolitions, but those who showed up still enjoyed themselves.</p>\n<p>"I just like seeing things blow up - probably like everyone else," said Matt Beil of\nWhitehouse.

T	Lehigh Valley workers finding jobs - The Morning Call
F	Lehigh Valley workers finding jobs - The Morning Call
C	After being unemployed for quite a while , Paul Bunting , has found a good job at Data Works International in Bethlehem . After nearly two years of unemployment , Paul Bunting 's luck finally turned , as it has recently for many other Lehigh Valley job seekers who are benefiting from the region 's improving economic fortunes . The 61-year-old Lower Nazareth Township resident , a database developer who worked as an independent contractor after a quarter century with AT&T , landed a job in May with Data Works International in Bethlehem . `` I really enjoy what I 'm doing , so I want to do as long as I can , '' said Bunting , explaining why did n't want to give in to early retirement . The Lehigh Valley 's unemployment rate in July remained below 6 percent for second month in a row , according to data released Tuesday by the state Department of Labor and Industry . The last time the rate was so low was September 2008 , during the early stages of the Great Recession . While the unemployment rate is widely believed to under-represent the longterm unemployed , it 's consistent improvement in recent months is at least partially the result of job creation . In May , the region posted a record-high number of non-farm jobs , finally surpassing its pre-recession high . The seasonally adjusted total of 349,200 jobs was 2,900 more than the previous peak in October and November 2007 , just before the start of the recession . `` The trends are positive , '' Bethlehem economist Kamran Afshar said . The Lehigh Valley still needs to add many thousands of jobs to match the region 's population growth over the past seven years , Afshar said . But he also noted the Kamran Afshar-Greater Lehigh Valley Chamber of Commerce survey in July found that area businesses are optimistic about the economy and are planning to increase hiring and spending in coming months . `` There is more good news to come , '' he said . `` By fall , the trends will accelerate . '' According to the Labor Department data , the Lehigh Valley had a seasonally adjusted total of 347,200 jobs in July - a decline of 2,000 since the end of the school year , which is normal for summer when some teachers and other people whose work is tied to education find themselves out of work . But over the full year , the private sector made significant gains in a number of areas : Transportation and warehousing accounted for a record 18,700 jobs - 1,000 more than the previous July . And leisure and hospitality , with 900 more jobs , is at a record high 38,100 jobs The construction , mining and logging sector , meanwhile , continues to grow . It added 400 jobs since the previous July , bringing its total to 13,400 . Driving construction is the redevelopment of downtown Allentown . Though some projects downtown , such as an office tower and the PPL Center hockey arena , will soon be winding down , other projects , including an apartment complex , are ramping up . Indeed , some of the area 's new businesses are already recruiting . Kathleen West , 61 , of Allentown , is among those who 've already found work downtown . She left a job in sales last summer . Over the course of the following year , she struggled to find a new job , at one point going several months without work . For a while , she worked at a grocery story , and for a while at a call center - jobs that paid $ 9 to $ 10 an hour . `` I struggled . I got depressed . I was thinking I was a failure , '' said West , who had a mortgage payment and heating oil bills hanging over her head . `` And then all the sudden , the sun came out . '' It was at a job fair at the Allentown headquarters of Pennsylvania CareerLink Lehigh Valley , a state-funded provider of job training and employment assistance , that she interviewed with Metropolitan Health Services of Herndon , Va. . Metropolitan hired her to work as an ambassador , or guide , at Lehigh Valley Health Network 's new office in the hockey arena complex . `` It 's the thing I do best , which is helping people , helping them get to where they want to be , '' West said . `` It 's exciting , and it 's full time , and I have benefits , and I like the people I work for ... I could n't ask for anything better . '' Bunting also turned to CareerLink for help when he was unemployed . Now that he has a job , he continues to volunteer for the organization , providing his database programming skills to its Lehigh Valley Professionals group . That group , whose weekly meetings are directed toward long-term unemployed white-collar workers , has gotten smaller and smaller recently , he said , suggesting past participants have returned to work . `` We used to have 100 people , '' he said . `` This past week , it was down to 40 . '' Nancy Dischinat , the director of CareerLink , said the Lehigh Valley has lots of work . The challenge , she said , is matching it to job candidates with the right skills .

"By fall, the trends will accelerate."</p>\n<p>According to the Labor Department data, the Lehigh Valley had a seasonally adjusted total\nof 347,200 jobs in July - a decline of 2,000 since the end of the school year, which is normal\nfor summer when some teachers and other people whose work is tied to education find themselves\nout of work.</p>\n<p>But over the full year, the private sector made significant gains in a number of areas:</p>\n<p>Transportation and warehousing accounted for a record 18,700 jobs - 1,000 more than the\nprevious July. And leisure and hospitality, with 900 more jobs, is at a record high 38,100\njobs</p>\n<p>The construction, mining and logging sector, meanwhile, continues to grow. It added 400\njobs since the previous July, bringing its total to 13,400. Driving construction is the\nredevelopment of downtown Allentown.</p>\n<p>Though some projects downtown, such as an office tower and the PPL Center hockey arena,\nwill soon be winding down, other projects, including an apartment complex, are ramping up.\nIndeed, some of the area's new businesses are already recruiting.</p>\n<p>Kathleen West, 61, of Allentown, is among those who've already found work downtown.</p>\n<p>She left a job in sales last summer. Over the course of the following year, she struggled\nto find a new job, at one point going several months without work. For a while, she worked at\na grocery story, and for a while at a call center - jobs that paid $9 to $10 an hour.</p>\n<p>"I struggled. I got depressed. I was thinking I was a failure," said West, who had a\nmortgage payment and heating oil bills hanging over her head. "And then all the sudden, the\nsun came out."</p>\n<p>It was at a job fair at the Allentown headquarters of Pennsylvania CareerLink Lehigh\nValley, a state-funded provider of job training and employment assistance, that she\ninterviewed with Metropolitan Health Services of Herndon, Va. Metropolitan hired her to work\nas an ambassador, or guide, at Lehigh Valley Health Network's new office in the hockey arena\ncomplex.</p>\n<p>"It's the thing I do best, which is helping people, helping them get to where they want to\nbe," West said. "It's exciting, and it's full time, and I have benefits, and I like the people\nI work for… I couldn't ask for anything better."</p>\n<p>Bunting also turned to CareerLink for help when he was unemployed. Now that he has a job,\nhe continues to volunteer for the organization, providing his database programming skills to\nits Lehigh Valley Professionals group.</p>\n<p>That group, whose weekly meetings are directed toward long-term unemployed white-collar\nworkers, has gotten smaller and smaller recently, he said, suggesting past participants have\nreturned to work.</p>\n<p>"We used to have 100 people," he said. "This past week, it was down to 40."</p>\n<p>Nancy Dischinat, the director of CareerLink, said the Lehigh Valley has lots of work. The\nchallenge, she said, is matching it to job candidates with the right skills.</p>\nOcean City police release few details in assault death of North Whitehall man

Threats like Duqu , a sophisticated worm found in the wild that appeared to share portions of its code with the Stuxnet worm , emerge with increasing frequency . Explaining how to develop and implement an effective cybersecurity program for ICS , Cybersecurity for Industrial Control Systems : SCADA , DCS , PLC , HMI , and SIS provides you with the tools to ensure network security without sacrificing the efficiency and functionality of ICS . Highlighting the key issues that need to be addressed , the book begins with a thorough introduction to ICS . It discusses business , cost , competitive , and regulatory drivers and the conflicting priorities of convergence . Next , it explains why security requirements differ from IT to ICS . It differentiates when standard IT security solutions can be used and where SCADA-specific practices are required . The book examines the plethora of potential threats to ICS , including hi-jacking malware , botnets , spam engines , and porn dialers . It outlines the range of vulnerabilities inherent in the ICS quest for efficiency and functionality that necessitates risk behavior such as remote access and control of critical equipment . Reviewing risk assessment techniques and the evolving risk assessment process , the text concludes by examining what is on the horizon for ICS security , including IPv6 , ICSv6 test lab designs , and IPv6 and ICS sensors .

F	Mike Tindall joined Gloucester to play alongside James Simpson-Daniel | Gloucester Citizen
C	Mike Tindall joined Gloucester to play alongside James Simpson-Daniel The Citizen | Posted : September 03 , 2014 Mike Tindall and James Simpson-Daniel with Monbeg Dude Mike Tindall has revealed he joined Gloucester simply to play alongside James Simpson-Daniel . The Cherry and Whites record try scorer was forced to announce his retirement this week , just two months after his close friend was left to do the same after not being offered a contract at the club . The duo , who were both ushers at their respective weddings , spent nine seasons playing alongside each other at Kingsholm . And it was the lure of linking up with the `` phenomenally '' talented wing that sealed Tindall 's decision to join Gloucester from bitter rivals Bath . Gloucester Rugby 's greatest ? Fans say none better than James Simpson-Daniel Andy Hazell hails James Simpson-Daniel as the best of England 's golden generation Tindall said : `` One of the main , if not the biggest , reasons I joined Gloucester was because of players like James and fortunately I have been lucky enough to share nine years with him at club level and a couple internationally . `` He was just phenomenal in every respect . What he can do in terms of out and out speed and footwork , his vision and understanding of the game , you rarely get players that have all of the attributes but he did and he embodied them all . '' Like Andy Hazell , Tindall reckons Simpson-Daniel should have won far more caps than the 10 he received in a career littered with injuries and illnesses . Tindall ranks the wing as one of the finest talents he has played with or against at any level and believes he could have represented the British and Irish Lions . But the World Cup winner has stressed that you can not dwell on the ` what ifs ' and ` could have beens ' and that Simpson-Daniel should be remembered for sheer enjoyment he gave supporters . Tindall said : `` He 's an unbelievable talent , he should have easily had 40 plus caps and if he had done that , who knows , he could have been a Lion . `` It was just timing , those injuries and illnesses came at the worst possible times and then in the last few years they have been looking to the future . `` But he has been the best England player , up there with Jason Robinson , in recent times in terms of what he could do . `` The disappointing thing is he is retiring because of injury but everyone on Twitter has been talking about that try he set up against Wasps and the one he scored against Jonah Lomu and that 's what he should be remembered for . `` I hope people remember him for what he did rather than what he missed out on because some of the stuff he has created and tries scored were simply phenomenal . '' Tindall was looking forward to watching Simpson-Daniel , whom he co-owns racehorse Monbeg Dude , from the stands during his first season as a supporter . And he reckons it is the end of an era for Gloucester with so many of the old guard retiring in recent seasons . He added : `` We have been best mates pretty much from when I arrived at the club . We are very similar thinking , he 's slightly grumpier than me but we balance each other out , we both like horses and to have a punt and when Nicky Robinson was also at the club we were thick as thieves . `` He 's someone I know I can always rely on and hopefully he knows that is the same in return . `` From the moment I saw the injury I knew it would be nasty but I always thought he would get back and I 'm so gutted that 's not the case . `` During my own first year as a fan I was looking forward to seeing him play and giving him some abuse for the rare thing he did wrong .

F	ISIS magazine claims group has enslaved and sold Yazidi women and kids | Fox News
C	Aug. 12 , 2014 : Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community gather for humanitarian aid at Nowruz camp , in Derike , Syria . A magazine purportedly published by the Islamic State group says that militants have captured , enslaved and sold Yazidi women and children , confirming allegations that have been made against the group for months . The claim came as Human Rights Watch said Sunday that hundreds of Yazidi men , women and children from Iraq are being held in makeshift detention facilities in Iraq and Syria by the group , commonly known as ISIS . ADVERTISEMENT Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled into the Sinjar Mountains , many getting stranded there for weeks , after the militant onslaught on Sinjar in August , part of the Islamic State group 's lightning advance across northern and western Iraq . Hundreds were killed in the attack , and tens of thousands fled for their lives , most to the Kurdish-held parts of northern Iraq .

C	( NEW YORK ) -- Police in New York were searching Saturday for a man who popped up from a sidewalk subway hatch and lobbed a smoke bomb at a pair of restaurants , sending diners scrambling . The man was captured on video emerging from a hatch used for emergency exits from the New York subway system . The hatches are used by emergency responders to evacuate riders from the subway if necessary . On security video , diners were seen fleeing their tables as smoke started to overtake the outdoor eating areas for the Da Silvano restaurant and the Bar Pitti restaurant . According to the New York Police Department , no one was injured . One of those at the restaurant was actress Rose McGowan , who tweeted about her experience shortly after the smoke cleared . Someone just threw two red smoke bombs into the restaurant I was eating in . Eyes are burning . October 10 , 2014 Police said they were looking for a white male approximately 20 years old with blond wavy hair . While diners were unharmed , at least one expert said law enforcement should be concerned that the man was able to both exit and enter the emergency subway gate without being captured . Former FBI agent Brad Garrett said the event could be a good learning experience for authorities to understand how emergency services might respond in a similar attack . `` It 's clearly a wake-up call , '' said Garrett , an ABC News contributor . `` When you get into a city of the size of New York or even just the one borough of Manhattan , you literally can not cover every single avenue . You do the best you can and try to learn from every situation and figure out where you have a vulnerability . '' The New York Police Department Public Information Office told ABC News they had no updates on the case or whether added security will be used to protect subway emergency exits .

C	A third of Wee County kids have poor ` net access 0 comments A THIRD of schools in Clackmannanshire have slow internet broadband , according to a new report . Share this image Research by the British Educational Suppliers Association ( BESA ) found that 29 per cent of pupils and teachers in the county had `` poor access '' to the internet . Information and Communication Technology ( ICT ) co-ordinators at 727 primary and 498 secondary schools across England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland were surveyed for the annual ` ICT in UK State Schools ' report . The report found that 65 per cent of primary schools and 54 per cent of secondary schools complained that access to wi-fi was `` under-resourced '' and nearly half of primary schools and a third of secondary schools reported inadequate broadband . Researchers concluded that there is a risk of a digital divide between rural and urban schools . The BESA is a trade body that represents more than 300 educational suppliers in the UK , including those that supply ICT hardware . Director , Caroline Wright , said , `` There appears to be an emerging tendency for rural schools to restrict their adoption of new mobile technologies because of connectivity issues in the classroom . `` It is of concern that children in rural schools may be denied access to the latest innovative digital education learning content because of a mismatch in broadband and Wi-Fi connectivity , as the findings of our research imply . `` In a 21st century online economy , classroom connectivity to a digital world of knowledge and resources should be a right for every student in their place of learning and not a regional lottery . '' However according to Clackmannanshire Council the majority of its schools have `` very good '' internet access and it disputed the survey 's conclusions . A council spokeswoman said that Alva Academy , Alva Primary , Banchory , St Serf 's , Abercromby , Deerpark and Craigbank have all had their network connections upgraded within the last year and now have connection speeds averaging 500Mbps . She added that Muckhart and Strathdevon Primary Schools had limited broadband speeds due to their locations but confirmed that plans are being developed to improve broadband capacity there . The spokeswoman added , `` This report , while interesting , is commissioned on behalf of the British Education Suppliers Association and is focused specifically on uptake of tablet devices . While tablets are useful they are not always the most appropriate tool to use in schools as many pieces of educational software wo n't work on them . `` There are a very large number of laptops and wifi enable portable netbooks in Clackmannanshire schools . Tablets are being introduced to Clackmanannshire schools as part of our scheduled hardware refresh programme where there is an identified need for them .

F	Homeland Security orders new screening for Ebola - The Denver Post
C	WASHINGTON ( AP ) - Everyone coming to the United States from the three West African countries at the center of the Ebola outbreak will now be screened for the deadly disease at one of five airports , the Homeland Security Department said Tuesday . Earlier this month , Customs and Border Protection officers at New York 's Kennedy , Newark Liberty , Washington 's Dulles , Chicago 's O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airports started screening people arriving from West Africa . The screening includes using no-touch thermometers to determine if travelers have a temperature , one symptom of a possible Ebola infection .

C	Hope for first-time buyers as 10pc deposits to return Kenny plans scheme to bypass Central Bank 's stricter home-loan rules Comments The Taoiseach has made a public intervention in the developing row over the Central Bank plans to cap mortgage lending . Home ownership should remain an `` attainable ambition for young credit-worthy families '' , Enda Kenny said during a speech in Dublin . Controversy has been raging over Central Bank proposals to cap most mortgages at a maximum of 80pc of the price of a house . However , the Irish Independent understands the Government is now planning to get around the plan through a new insurance scheme . Under plans that are still to be teased out , a portion of any new home loan to first-time buyers will be guaranteed by the State . It is based on schemes in Canada , Finland and the UK . It comes as new figures show house prices nationally have increased by 15pc in the past year , though the pace of the increase is slowing in the capital . The Government scheme will mean lending is a lower risk for the bank , and can be achieved using a mortgage insurance scheme for first time buyers , paid for by lenders but with the Government standing behind it . The plan will allow first-time buyers to purchase homes with deposits of 10pc of the house price , half of what will be needed if new Central Bank rules kick in from January without any intervention . The idea is to restrict the scheme to buyers of new-build homes in order to stimulate the construction sector . Crucially , from the Central Bank 's perspective , the element of risk-sharing means lenders would still have the 20pc cushion against house price falls that the planned lending cap is designed to ensure . The planned boost to mortgage funding is also expected to provide certainty to the construction industry , which is reluctant to build homes because of tight profit margins . But it 's not clear how soon the government plan will come on stream . The Central Bank plans to cap most home loans at 80pc of the value of a property from January under surprise proposals published earlier this month . That is to insulate banks from the effects of any new bubble . The plan is currently going through a consultation process that is due to end on December 8 . If it goes through unchanged , house buyers will need savings of € 60,000 to purchase a € 300,000 home - the price of an apartment or small house in most of Dublin , for example . The Central Bank plan would also limit the size of a mortgage to three-and-a-half times a family 's income , which is less controversial . Unlike other state agencies , the Government has no power to order the Central Bank to change tack . But in his speech , the Taoiseach insisted that home ownership should remain within reach of ordinary families , even as he warned against a return to reckless lending . `` There can be no going back to the past , when reckless mortgage and property lending by banks wrecked Ireland 's financial stability , resulting in massive taxpayer bail-outs and job losses . Ambition `` At the same time , this Government wants home ownership to remain an attainable ambition for young , credit-worthy families . Without access to mortgage credit , young families will place increasing demands on the rental and social housing markets , '' he said He was speaking in Croke Park at a construction conference organised by Grant Thornton , where he resurrected the idea of introducing a mortgage guarantee scheme . That was first floated in May , in the Government 's Construction 2020 plan to revive the building sector . The original idea would have allowed for loans of up to 95pc of the price of a newly built house . It appeared to have been quietly shelved over the summer , and was not contained in the Budget . But the Irish Independent understands the Taoiseach 's speech was a signal that a modified version of the plan is back on the table - though now requiring a 10pc deposit . Mr Kenny said other countries had been able to avoid property bubbles without blocking people from the market . `` In the UK , Finland and Canada , for example , mortgage insurance markets have been developed to support mortgage lending to first-time buyers , while also improving the quality of such lending and reducing the risk to the banks themselves . '' Finance Minister Michael Noonan will now ask the Oireachtas Committee on Finance to prepare a report on the issue , he said . But he gave no timeline for action . Tanaiste Joan Burton has already questioned the rules proposed by the Central Bank . Environment Minister Alan Kelly described the 20pc requirement as `` excessive '' and called for a 15pc deposit target . First-time buyers ' hope as Taoiseach plans 10pc mortgage deposits Donal O'Donovan , Charlie Weston and Fionnan Sheahan First-time buyers will be able to get onto the property ladder as the Taoiseach has bypassed the Central Bank 's strict home-loan rules .

C	Thursday , November 13 , 2014 12:21 p.m. EST By Mary Wisniewski CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - A Chicago parks protection group sued the city on Thursday over a planned museum by `` Star Wars '' filmmaker George Lucas , saying the site is on a lakefront spot that can not be handed over to a private entity . The Friends of the Parks said in its federal lawsuit that the proposed `` Lucas Museum of Narrative Art , '' which will include artifacts from his hit science fiction film series , violates the U.S. Constitution 's equal protection and due process clause . The museum was to be located on the same lakefront area as Chicago 's Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium . By allowing the development , the suit said the nation 's third-largest city and its park district will interfere with the right of citizens to `` use and enjoy property held in trust by the state of Illinois as a natural resource and pristine physical environment . '' The lawsuit sought to block the land transfer . Adam Collins , a spokesman for Mayor Rahm Emanuel , said the administration has n't yet seen the lawsuit and could not comment . He said the museum will be treated like others on the lakefront museum campus and comply with all laws . `` This museum is a generous gift that will expand the rich cultural and educational opportunities for children and families in every neighborhood , and visitors from around the world , '' said Collins , who said the museum would also create jobs . The museum will feature the director 's collection of paintings , illustrations and digital art , including works by Norman Rockwell , John Tenniel and Maxfield Parrish . Lucas had wanted to build it in San Francisco , but the proposal was rejected by a trust that governs the land it was intended to be on . Lucas ' wife , Mellody Hobson , is from Chicago . The museum said it selected its site near Chicago 's Soldier Field because of its accessibility to public transportation as well as its central location . A white , space-mountain-like design for the proposed museum was released last week , and has already caused controversy in a city known for its architecture . A representative for Lucas was not available for comment . 106.1 FM Lansing , Michigan Studio Line 1 : 517-363-2106

C	I 'm not the biggest fan of contact sports like boxing , wrestling , and most of all , mixed martial arts ( MMA ) . I always feel like the fighters are , well , fighting ... like , personally ! Hahaha ! I get even more worried when I see blood , and would be all , `` Why would they do that to each other ? WHYYYYYY ? '' Hahaha ! With Michael being a big UFC fan , however , I found myself slowly understanding the elements of MMA . I 'm still not the biggest fan , but now I understand the strategizing that goes with it , and how it 's not really about just brute force but more about techniques . Now , I even know some names of the fighters and I actually have some favorites ! BUT . My criteria for choosing a favorite is if I think he 's good , and ... kung mukha siyang mabait . HAHAHAHAHAHAHA . With BJ Penn at an ABS-CBN press conference , back when I was still a Kapamilya ( with overgrown bangs lol ) Michael with Mark Munoz . Mike interviewed him for a Men 's Health cover story . Yesterday ( Nov. 8 ) was my first time to watch a live MMA fight . ABS-CBN Sports + Action held the country 's first ever Fight Expo at the Eastwood Mall open area . Fist Gym - where Michael trains - was a partner , and so we went there to support . Michael and a few other Fist guys also played ring marshalls . One of the highlights of the event was the appearance of UFC fighter Carlos Condit - who is actually one of my favorites ( He does look kind , right ? Haha ! ) . They held a promo for a meet and greet . I did n't join that but as they were having people line up , one of the guys said they can accommodate four more people . Nobody was standing up to grab the slot , so Michael and I went for it . Michael also gave Carlos a Kunami San shirt , and he really appreciated it ! * kilig * TJ Manotoc and Jef Gaitan hosted the program Another highlight was the demo fights : Five boxing matches , and five MMA fights . Fist Gym owner Ros Rosete helped facilitate these , along with other experts and professional fighters , and he also played commentator during the MMA games . The fights really drew a big crowd at the Eastwood Mall . The fighters in both boxing and MMA did not disappoint : they all fought well , and the crowd was really entertained . I 'm especially proud of the guys who Mike trains with sometimes at Fist . They all won too ! Not to say that I got through the fights comfortably - medyo nakaka-tense kaya ! The boxing , medyo okay pa , but the MMA fights ... nakakaloka ! Especially with the respective fighters ringside crew yelling stuff like , `` Lumpuhin mo na ! '' or `` Wala nang hangin yan ! Bugbugin mo na ! '' Tapos makikita mo na may dugo o kaya maga na yung mata ... JUICE COLORED !!! I was standing beside one of the judges , and I was probably reacting quite loudly , that he told me , `` Ma'am , mauuna pa kayong ma-high blood sa mga fighters ! Relax lang ! '' Nakakahiya hahahaha ! Ros emphasized how we have a lot of great fighters in the country and how this kind of sport has a great potential . Boxing is already a given , considering we have a lot of Pinoy champions , but we also have a lot of talented MMA fighters that just need to be given the chance to show their stuff . To have a big network like ABS-CBN bring fighting to the forefront was a huge help , of course . And I do hope ABS-CBN , through Sports + Action keeps it up . The Fight Expo was a great start , and more than a marketing tool , it was a great move to put contact sports at the forefront and give new fighters the opportunity to showcase their skills . I also appreciated how they had as guests the country 's current champions , who may not be as popular as Pacquiao , but are well on their way . Putting arcade games was also a good touch . Should they hold Fight Expo again , I would suggest the following , based on my experience as a spectator ( and in events as well ) : - The venue could be more open to the crowd . While entrance was free , the event area was enclosed and felt a little exclusive - maybe it had something to do with the need to have people register . Many people opted to stay outside instead , despite repeated invitations that they come in . - Maybe hold quick Q&A games instead of a raffle , because raffles do n't usually work for whole day events , especially if it 's done in a mall area . While some of the winners were still there , some had already left . Mas dagdag excitement din yung on-the-spot prize , plus you can highlight the details you want by asking questions like `` Who is the sponsor of this event ? '' or `` What is ABS-CBN 's sports channel ? '' This can also give the guys outside a chance to join , dahil pwede silang lapitan ng host . - Create a hashtag for the event . The only hashtags that they asked be used were #rockitwithcondit and #domore ( Rexona 's tagline ) . As such , when Condit had already gone , there was no longer a hashtag we can associate with Fight Expo . - Have a ring designed especially for MMA fights . The fights were also held in the boxing ring , which has no ample protection for takedowns and other moves since they could easily slip through the ropes . Also it was a little too high . The ring marshals had to secure the ropes , and since it 's a taller than they are , their arms could only hold up to the second level . Even our tallest guy had a hard time with this . Good thing the referee was listo and would bounce the fighters off the ropes whenever malapit na silang mahulog . - Get a better VO . Nakakaloka yung male voice over , he was all over the place with his adlibs ! I wanted to find him and tell him to write down his spiels na lang instead of adlibbing kasi laging nawawala yung train of thought , puro tuloy buckle . It would also have helped if he addressed the crowd as `` Kapamilya sports fans '' , para associated na agad sa ABS-CBN and , based on my experience , that can easily get the attention of the crowd - which was his main goal anyway . He used this only once , during the latter part of the event . Overall , the Fight Expo was a great event and it has so much potential to be bigger - even bigger than the brand . Congratulations , ABS-CBN Sports + Action ! And kudos as well to Fist Gym , Ros , and all the fighters who participated !
H	<div class='post-body entry-content' id='post-body-1391390089087931024'\nitemprop='description articleBody'>I'm not the biggest fan of contact sports like boxing,\nwrestling, and most of all, mixed martial arts (MMA). I always feel like the fighters are,\nwell, fighting… like, personally! Hahaha! I get even more worried when I see blood, and would\nbe all, "Why would they do that to each other? WHYYYYYY?" Hahaha!<br />\n<br />\nWith Michael being a big UFC fan, however, I found myself slowly understanding the elements of\nMMA. I'm still not the biggest fan, but now I understand the strategizing that goes with it,\nand how it's not really about just brute force but more about techniques. Now, I even know\nsome names of the fighters and I actually have some favorites! BUT. My criteria for choosing a\nfavorite is if I think he's good, and... kung mukha siyang mabait.

Harrison tied her career high with 35 minutes and finished with 20 points , 12 rebounds and five blocks Sunday in leading No. 8 Tennessee past No. 10 Oregon State 74-63 . `` I have n't played that many minutes since last year , '' Harrison said with a laugh . `` You know , I got my cardio for sure today . It helped , but I just have to get used to that many minutes . '' Freshman Alexa Middleton added 12 points off the bench , and the Lady Vols ( 10-2 ) handed the Beavers ( 10-1 ) their first loss . Tennessee has now defeated two straight top-10 opponents . The Lady Vols beat Stanford 59-40 on Dec. 20 . Guard Sydney Wiese led Oregon State with 19 points on 6-for-17 shooting . Ali Gibson added 14 points - 12 in the second half . Middleton scored six consecutive points midway through the second half , and her jumper from the top of the key with 8:10 to play gave the Lady Vols a 56-52 lead . She hit five of her six shots . `` I 've just been making a point ( during practice ) to get up extra shots , '' Middleton said . `` We had a good practice yesterday . I guess that carried over . '' Tennessee maintained a seven-point cushion down the stretch at the foul line , though the Lady Vols made just 22 of 34 free throws overall . Oregon State went to the line only nine times and made seven . The Beavers did n't make a field goal the final 3:37 and failed to score the final 1:47 . They missed all seven 3-pointers after the break , having made 6 of 9 in the first half . Tennessee trailed late in the first half but scored the final six points to go up 35-34 . `` That 's a huge win for us , '' Tennessee coach Holly Warlick said . `` They 're just a difficult team to play . They shoot the 3 and penetrate . Someone asked me if they should be in the top 10 . No question . '' Wiese entered the game shooting 52 percent from the 3-point line and made her first three 3s Sunday . She wound up 3-for-7 from behind the arc . Tennessee scored 26 points off 19 Oregon State turnovers . `` They have the ability to pressure more than most teams , '' Oregon State coach Scott Rueck said . `` That 's how they survive and live . They thrive off that . '' TIP-INS Oregon State : Ruth Hamblin , a 6-foot-6 junior center , broke the school 's career blocks record . She needed one against the Lady Vols to match the 208 by Brina Chaney from 2001-04 . Hamblin blocked two shots against Tennessee and has 36 this season in 11 games . Tennessee : The Lady Vols had more Oregonians on their roster than did Oregon State .

F	Going Green May Soon Be Harder
C	CALLAWAY -- Going green may soon be harder for residents and businesses after a recent decision by the Florida Public Service Commission to end Florida 's Solar Pilot program after 2015 . The program provides financial support to pay for the initial start up of installing the solar unit . Brothers Patrick and Brian of Muth & Sons Plumbing have installed solar units ever since they were young boys with their grandfather . The two installed one particular solar system just five years ago and said it 's just about paid off . The $ 18,000 , 24 panel system generates 4,800 watts of power and has 90 % annual solar efficiency . `` So we do n't know what to do right now . We get a lot of phone calls with people that are just very confused as to what to do , so they 're taking matters into their own hands . They 're doing their own math and their own calculations and they come to the same conclusion : this saves money , '' said Patrick Muth . The federal renewable energy tax covers 30 % of the initial cost of the system , which will soon be ending by the end of 2015 . There are currently no active polls at this time . 8195 Front Beach Road Panama City Beach , FL 32407 Station : 850-234-7777 News : 850-230-5221 Fax : 850-233-6647 × Online Public Information File Viewers with disabilities can get assistance accessing this station 's FCC Public Inspection File by contacting the station with the information listed below .

C	Man awakens from 12 years in ` vegetative state ' Posted By - NO AUTHOR - On 01/12/2015 @ 8:33 pm Martin Pistorious fell into a mysterious coma when he was a vibrant 12-year-old boy in the 1980s . He found himself locked inside his own body - unable to speak , make eye contact or even move his own limbs . Martin 's doctors told his parents , Rodney and Joan Pistorious , that the boy had cryptococci meningitis . They said Martin should be taken home to die in peace . But Martin would live 12 years in that vegetative state . Joan said , `` Martin just kept going , just kept going . '' According to NPR , Martin 's father would wake up every day at 5 a.m. , dress the boy , put him in the car and drive him to a special care center . `` Eight hours later , I 'd pick him up , bathe him , feed him , put him in bed , set my alarm for two hours so that I 'd wake up to turn him so that he did n't get bedsores , '' Rodney recalled . Read the heart-wrenching , true story of Terri Schiavo . And during those 12 years , according to the Pistorious family , there was never any indication that Martin 's condition was improving . One day , Joan , in a state of hopelessness , told her son , `` I hope you die . '' She never imagined that Martin would have understood those dreadful words . 1987 photo is the final image of the Pistorius family before Martin became ill . He is at the right . But by the time he was 14 or 15 years old , Martin began to awaken . `` Yes , I was there , not from the very beginning , but about two years into my vegetative state , I began to wake up , '' Martin recalls . `` I was aware of everything , just like any normal person . Everyone was so used to me not being there that they did n't notice when I began to be present again .

F	Paris to Ban the Most Polluting Diesel Vehicles by 2020 - ABC News
C	Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has presented a plan to ban most diesel vehicles from the city by 2020 in order to lower air pollution . By July , diesel buses and trucks will be banned during the daytime from entering the city but not from the ring road around Paris , Hidalgo explained Monday in a plan to members of the Paris Council .

F	Jim Rogers Optimistic about Agriculture in Ukraine | JIM ROGERS BLOG
C	Nick : Excellent points that you make , Jim . I want to shift gears a little bit . I know you 're a fan of agriculture , and parts of Russia and Ukraine are among the most fertile regions in the world . Investing there is a nice way to get into agriculture and also Russia at the same time . What do you think about companies and stocks that own and operate farmland in that region ? Jim Roger : Well , historically you 're right . Ukraine was one of the major breadbaskets of the world , and some of those vast Russian lands were great breadbaskets at times in history . Communism can and does ruin everything it touches . It ruined Soviet agriculture , but many of those places have great potential and will revive . I have n't actually gone and examined the soil myself to see that it 's still fertile , but I assume it is because you see the production numbers . That part of the world should be and will be great agricultural producers again . It 's just a question of when and who . By the way , I have recently become a director of a large Russian phosphorous/fertilizer company , partly for the reasons you 're discussing . excerpt from an interview by Nick Giambruno via Doug Casey 's International Man blog . Jim Rogers started trading the stock market with $ 600 in 1968 . In 1973 he formed the Quantum Fund with the legendary investor George Soros before retiring , a multi millionaire at the age of 37 . Rogers and Soros helped steer the fund to a miraculous 4,200 % return over the 10 year span of the fund while the S&P 500 returned just 47 % .

F	Crochet Queen: Royal Ramblings: For the Love of Granddaughters!
C	Learning about the letter Y this week in the Junior Kindergarten class at my granddaughter 's school in Indianapolis was perfect timing ! `` Yarn '' starts with Y and it 's National Crochet Month . Not exactly a coincidence because both of the wonderfully patient teachers are savvy crafters ! My grandaughter , Chloe , loves her class ; and I was thrilled to be invited as guest speaker to talk about '' Y arn bombing '' this week . The 200-mile trip was well worth it when I saw the enthusiastic and adorable children gathered in their circle waiting for my arrival . Yarn Galore ! Yarn-Bombing Sticks I crochet for fun and to stretch my creativity . Sometimes finished projects just lay in a drawer wating to be appreciated , so I had fun pulling out things to show , keeping in mind that tactile is the way to go with 5 year olds ! I felt so warmly welcomed by the teachers who had already introduced yarn bombing on Monday . The kids wrapped yarn around sticks and created a gorgeous bird and kitty out of yarn ! Chloe stepped right up to be my helper to pass examples around for everyone to touch . Chloe My Helper Interestingly , the boys were very excited to try on the `` Flamingo '' and `` Palm Tree '' necklaces . Passing around the Flamingo Necklace Trying On the Flamingo Necklace 1983 : Flamingo Necklace ; crochet , various fibers I showed slides of yarn-bombings I have done as well as others from across the U. S. Book with examples of crochet & knit bombs These were particularly exciting to the kids ! Vine Hat Chloe modeled an artsy hat I crocheted from a pattern in the seventies . She looked fantastic in this classic ! Later that afternoon , the class yarn-bombed a tree in their school yard ! They did a beautiful job ! I donated a copy of my second book , Kids Can Do It Crocheting to the classroom and hopefully , I have birthed some life-long crocheters today ! Kids Can Do It Crocheting

C	HTC One M9 vs Samsung Galaxy Note 4 vs LG G3 cameras : A quick performance comparison Channel 4 is making the biggest changes to its on demand offering since launching 4oD almost nine years ago . For a start , the name is being ditched in favour of `` All 4 '' - representing the fact that it will contain catch-up , on demand and live streams for all of the broadcaster 's channels . And it can even be seen as an additional station in its own right as exclusive short content will be carried on the new platform . It launches with an extensive list of new features on Monday 30 March for PC , iPhone , iPad and iPod touch , with an Android version to follow later this year . All current 4oD applications and services will also be rebranded with All 4 's design and logo , but will still offer the same on demand offering as the current 4oD service . Those with iOS devices , PCs or laptops will gain access to a large swathe of significant changes , not least live telly . Pocket-lint was invited to Channel 4 's London HQ to try out the new app for iPad ( and get a glimpse at the browser portal for computers ) ahead of the official release and we can safely say that it is a marked step forward for Channel 4 - something that puts it on a par , if not ahead of BBC iPlayer in the amount of features offered . 4oD is dead , long live All 4 : Channel 4 's new on demand service launches 30 March In the centre is the Now menu , which is limited to live TV on tablets and smartphones . You can watch any of the current broadcasts from all of the broadcaster 's channels from here , even streamed over 3G or 4G . This section comes to life even more when viewed on a computer as it offers additional features and related content . News clips will appear under Now , for example . And there will be interactive elements on the browser version in future . A lot of the original features of 4oD also remain , including the ability to download a lot of the content for offline viewing ( licences permitted ) and the picture quality will remain SD for now . Pocket-lint was told that there are other things to be done to improve the service ahead of HD streaming in the priority list .

C	the `` A '' reveal , which means it 's time to double down on your `` A '' theories once and for all . No more dithering between two options . It 's do or die time . Who do YOU think `` A '' is ? Vote in our poll , then outline your theory in the comments below ! Alison 's twin . The prospect of Ali 's twin has been an enticing one since the beginning - partially because `` A '' was Courtney DiLaurentis in the book series and partially because PLL the TV show has dropped many a twin clue over the seasons . However , showrunner Marlene King not appear in the show . Is she bluffing ? Will Ali 's twin appear with a different name ? After all of these seasons of twin clues , it 's hard not to find this theory valid . Someone else 's twin . When Marlene denied the existence of Courtney DiLaurentis in the TV show universe , she hinted that might have a twin . Could this be `` A '' ? If so , there are so many options . It seems likely that , if there is a secret twin , he or she is part of the DiLaurentis and/or Hastings families . Does Jason have a secret twin no one knows about ? Or could it be Melissa or Spencer who has an evil doppelganger running about town ? Or maybe it 's not someone in the DiHastings family at all . Maybe Mona is the Rosewood resident with a less-than-compassionate look alike ... Alison Is `` A '' theory pretty hard earlier this season , so much so that we never really believed it . Now that they 're not pushing it , and even redeeming Ali , we 're not as sure . It seems drastic that Ali would let herself go away for murder if she is , in fact , `` A , '' but the villain works in mysterious ways . Odds are Alison is n't `` A , '' but the girl does have many , many secrets . We 're not sure if we 'll ever really know Alison DiLaurentis , which means there 's a possibility she 's been pulling the strings since the beginning . Mona . Face it : Rosewood has never seen anyone as brilliant and ruthless as Mona Vanderwaal . Sure , she seems pretty dead right now and , before that , claimed to reform her `` A '' ways , but she has also proven capable of pulling off elaborate ruses . The Liars ' legal dilemmas kicked into high gear when Mona was apparently murdered . Her death set this entire frame job into motion . PLL really wanted to go big , they would reveal Aria , or Emily as the infamous `` A. '' This would not only make a lot of sense on the logistical level - how else would `` A '' always know what Team Liar was up to ? - but would present some pretty compelling storylines moving forward . For the Liars to be betrayed by one of their own would be heartbreaking , but also super interesting . Aria has long been a popular `` A '' suspect , but any of the Liars PLL risk alienating its fan base by revealing one of our beloved Liars as `` A '' ? One of the parents . We 're pretty sure the Rosewood parents ' main crime is being super neglectful , but could their hyperbolic absence hint at a larger conspiracy ? It seems unlikely that a teen drama would take the agency and narrative out of the teen arena and give it to the older characters , but it would also be kind of interesting . What teen has n't at one point felt like the adults are around just to make life difficult for them ? Could PLL be taking that paranoia to the next level ? Could one ( or more than one ) of the parents be `` A '' ? PLL tends to point its finger at the Liars ' significant others every once in a while just to keep things dramatic , but - so far - those moments have all been `` A '' red herrings . Sure , Ezra was a creeper , but he was n't `` A. '' Could the show have been saving the ultimate betrayal for this moment ? Could Ezra , Caleb , Toby , or Paige be `` A '' ? We 're particularly worried that Caleb or Paige could be the `` A '' in question - if only because neither of them has ever really been suspected of being `` A. '' ( The Liars thought Paige might be complicit in Season 3 , but that theory did n't last long . ) PLL is populated with suspicious characters and so many of them make excellent `` A '' suspects . Wren . Melissa . Jason . Jenna . Lucas . The list goes on . Does your `` A '' theory include one of these sketchballs ? Who do you think is `` A '' ?

C	Gung-ho after winning the Man of the Match award against the UAE in the World Cup , South Africa skipper AB de Villiers on Thursday said he tries to keep things simple out there in the middle . It was de Villiers 's swashbuckling knock of 99 and two wickets in the Pool B game that propelled South Africa to 341 for six in Thursday 's match . He hit six fours and four sixes en route . Chasing the mammoth total , the United Arab Emirates folded up for 195 runs . `` I wo n't say it 's easy , but I try to keep it simple . I try to stick to my game plan .

The skipper , who also clinched the record for hitting the most number of sixes at the world event , said the game was a platform where he gave opportunities to his part-timers so that they could deliver the goods in the knockout stage too . `` It was an opportunity tonight to give some of the part-time bowlers a run . I got through all of us and it looks pretty good and might come in handy in one of the knockout games . `` It 's not a given fact that we are going to play seven batters once again , but if we do , it 's nice to have the guys with some decent form with the ball and if the guys that are not seen as full-time bowlers - myself , JP ( Duminy ) , Farhaan ( Behardien ) and guys like that and maybe even Faf ( du Plessis ) - can chip in , it 's good for the team , '' he said .

Kafoury , 72 , served as the District 2 Commissioner representing Northeast Portland between 1985 and 1990 . She is the mother of Chair Deborah Kafoury . A memorial service for Gretchen Kafoury will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday , April 4 at the First Congregational United Church of Christ , 1126 S.W. Park Ave. in Portland . Gretchen Kafoury was a former three-term legislator and working as the human services coordinator for the city of Portland when she was elected to the Multnomah County Board . As commissioner , she continued her legislative priorities of health care and mental health care while adding criminal justice , homelessness and school-based health centers to the list . She was also an activist . Nine days after taking office in January 1985 , she marched on the office of the South African consul in Portland to protest apartheid . Within three months , she spearheaded a controversial resolution to ban discrimination in county hiring on the basis of sexual orientation . As someone who lobbied for gay rights bills during the 1973 Legislature only to see them fail by a few votes , she strategically pursued a county ban by resolution - instead of by ordinance - in order to ensure the measure survived . As a Multnomah County commissioner , she championed the needs of young people , helping to bring county services for pregnant and drug - and alcohol-affected teens to east Multnomah County neighborhoods . She oversaw the opening of a primary care health center at Roosevelt High School in 1986 , the first of what would become 13 school-based health clinics . She also worked to strengthen public safety and prevent crime . She advocated for the construction of new dorms at Inverness Jail and additional residential treatment for drug - and alcohol-addicted inmates , and was a key supporter of the forest work camp and restitution center . She also voted to transform the private Library Association of Portland into the Multnomah County Library system . As a young woman , Gretchen Kafoury had campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy during the 1968 presidential campaign , `` galvanized , '' she said , by idealism . She became an advocate of gun control after his assassination . In March 1990 , Commissioner Kafoury cast the deciding vote to enact the first local gun control ordinance in Oregon .

MORE MUD LAKE , Idaho ( AP ) - Wildlife officials say 2,000 migrating snow geese have died in eastern Idaho , likely from a disease that can cause birds to die in midflight and drop out of the sky . The Idaho Department of Fish and Game says staff and volunteers collected the dead birds over the past several days at wildlife management areas near the towns of Terreton and Roberts . They say the cause of death likely was avian cholera . Authorities say the geese were migrating from the Southwest and Mexico to breeding grounds on the north coast of Alaska . Fish and Game spokesman Steve Schmidt says it 's unclear where they picked up the bacteria . According to the U.S. Geological Survey 's National Wildlife Health Center , avian cholera comes on so quickly that birds with no previous signs of illness can die in flight and fall out of the sky .
